I will always treasure this thoughtful and special gift.<p>_Girlfriends_ is a collection of stories that explore and celebrate female friendship through the eyes, ears, and hearts of everyday women.  Some of the women were friends for a lifetime, others for a short time. However, all understood and/or demonstrated the meaning of &quot;true friendship.&quot; For example, the stories included everything from the thankful musings of a once-ill woman about the extraordinaty kindness of her girlfriends to a giggly account of how two eerily-simiar best friends met as assigned roomates their first day of college. (The latter tale struck very close to home in a wonderfully spooky way.)<p>While many of the stories tugged at the heartstrings, I never felt manipulated by the authors. (Note: Part of the reason why I don't like the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; series is that I feel that the authors are just dying to make the reader clutch for the box of tissues.)  Rather, I appreciated the &quot;real&quot; tone of the stories, as they read like good conversation shared over a nice pot of Hazlenut coffee.<p>Some readers have commented on the book's simple language and lack of depth.

Think again!  Feel frustrated and angry at the people around you who, no matter how much you plead, won't change and start behaving the way you want?  Here's a solution.  <p>Dr. Harriet Lerner's &quot;The Dance of Anger&quot; provides a whole new approach for women who feel stuck and powerless.  Using case studies, Lerner demonstrates ways that women can change their reactions when other people's behavior and expectations upsets them.  Her basic premise:  You can't change how others treat you--you can only change how you respond.  Throughout the book, Lerner provides examples of how women can set boundaries with friends, family members and others so that they can break out of unsatisfying relationship patterns.<p>The &quot;Thinking in Threes&quot; chapter addresses ways that third parties get pulled into conflicts, and how to better handle these situations by focusing on the source of the conflict.<p>Lerner's book is an excellent source for learning a &quot;new dance&quot;--a new way of approaching life.  One caveat:  I question whether this approach would be safe or appropriate for someone dealing with domestic violence or an emotionally abusive relationship.  While several experts in that area have said that the reason people abuse is because it works, making the abuse no longer work by using Lerner's approach of changing one's reaction to that behavior could make the abuse escalate.  From the training I've received in domestic violence (I'm not a therapist but I do have some professional training in this area), I believe that the most dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship occurs when she tries to get out of that relationship.  Changing one's response to abusive behavior under Lerner's recommendations might make the situation more dangerous.\"]\n",

Her goal is to help keep those little annoyances and stressors out of our lives, to stop the stupid arguments over who forgot to pick up the mail.\\t\\tIf you have ever wanted to stop letting the small matters snowball into big problems, please read this book.

I don't see how labeling some anger patterns as typically male or female is supposed to help clarify anger patterns in oneself.  In fact, I find it counterproductive and distracting from the real matter.  Isn't the point to find out what anger patterns you might be exhibiting in your own life and create positive ones?  Why not leave the gender stuff out of it and discuss different healthy and unhealthy anger patterns for people to identify with or not?  Why sidetrack and convolute the issue by saying females will typically act this way, and males will typically act this way, when the author even says this isn't always true?

Rosenberg (his Center for Nonviolent Communication trains in North America', ' Europe & UK', ' Malaysia and India and Rosenberg has a great book called \\\\\"The Surprising Purpose of Anger\\\\\").\\t\\tAlso', ' I have done a huge amount of \\\\\"work\\\\\" on myself for well over 2 decades yet all this wholehearted work did not result in much success with anger. Eventually - after more than TWO decades of wasted time and money (lots of time', ' lots of money)', ' I discovered uncontrollable anger is very strongly linked to health. ALL anger-advice books overlook insufficient adrenals', \" yet one of the MAJOR symptoms is constant irritation. (That's why this book gets it more right than most - adrenal fatigue definitely makes you fragile as well as a lot of other things\", ' like trouble sleeping and/or difficulty getting to sleep', ' overreacting/defensive', ' fatigue and/or jittery', ' lightheaded getting out of bed', ' and much more.)\\t\\tFinally', ' after decades of mis-diagnoses (very common', ' I have learned) serious low thyroid AND low adrenal function was identified', ' but only because I was finally lucky enough to come across \\\\\"Stop the Thyroid Madness\\\\\" (both website and book are excellent on both thyroid and adrenal issues). I had to arrange and pay for my own lab tests (the so-called \\\\\"gold standard\\\\\" tests are wrong!) and then (because most doctors', ' including endos', ' really do not understand) find a truly knowledgeable physician through patient recommendations on the \\\\\"Stop the Thyroid Madness\\\\\" website.\\t\\tAfter a few months of PROPER treatment my anger/irritability simply melted away! (slowly)\\t\\tThe more stress you have had in your lifetime', ' the more likely you are to have adrenal issues (I had a high-powered job for 20 years but then had to limp through the last ten years before I was able to retire by going part-time - which of course meant low quality work at much lower pay). So', ' here are some FREE home/self tests for identifying struggling adrenals:\\t\\tTEST ONE:\\tTake and compare two blood pressure readings--one while lying down and one while standing. Rest for five minutes while sitting before taking the first reading. Stand up and immediately take the blood pressure again. If either blood pressure reading is lower after standing', ' suspect adrenal gland problems', ' and more specifically', ' an aldosterone issue-another adrenal hormone. The degree to which the blood pressure drops while standing is often proportionate to the degree of hypoadrenalism. (Normal adrenal function will raise your BP on the standing reading in order to push blood to the brain.) It can be wise to do this test both in the morning and in the evening', ' since you can appear normal one time', ' and not another. (BP monitors are available cheaply on Amazon)\\t\\tTEST TWO:\\tLet someone shine a bright light your way. Do you find yourself very sensitive and uncomfortable with the bright light (similarly with bright summer sunshine)? That could be a sign of adrenal fatigue. And this can also be true if you have searing headaches along with the sensitivity.\\t\\tTEST THREE:\\tThis is called the Pupil test and primarily tests your levels of aldosterone', ' another adrenal hormone. You need to be in a darkened room with a mirror and a flashlight/ torch/ penlight. Do this later in the day as results are more reliable then. From the side (not the front)', ' shine a bright light towards your pupils and hold it for about a minute. Carefully observe the pupil. With healthy adrenals (and specifically', ' healthy levels of aldosterone)', ' your pupils will constrict', ' and will stay small the entire time you shine the light from the side. In adrenal fatigue', ' the pupil will get small', ' but within 30 seconds', ' it will soon enlarge again or obviously flutter in its attempt to stay constricted.\\t\\tWhy? Because adrenal insufficiency can also result in low aldosterone', ' which causes a lack of proper amounts of sodium and an abundance of potassium. This imbalance causes the sphincter muscles of your eye to be weak and to dilate in response to light. (Note: there are over 50 sphincters in the body and stress incontinence caused by adrenal fatigue is difficult to fix just with pelvic floor exercises.)\\t\\tTEST FOUR:\\tTake your temp 3 times a day', ' starting three hours after you wake up', ' and every three hours after that', \" to equal three temps. (If you have eaten or exercised right before it's time to take your temp\", ' wait 20 more minutes.) Then average them for that day. Do this for AT LEAST 5 days. If your averaged temp is fluctuating from day to day more than .2 to .3 (with a lean towards .2)', ' you need adrenal support. Again', ' your daily average temps should lean towards the .2 when on enough cortisol for your needs.\\t\\tIf your temps are fluctuating but overall low', ' you need both adrenal and thyroid support. If your temps are fluctuating but averaging 98.6', ' you just need adrenal support. If it is steady but low', ' you need thyroid support and adrenals are likely fine.\\t(mercury thermometers are the most accurate but very difficult to buy nowadays', ' next best are liquid thermometers', ' then digital thermometers - which can be wrong by up to 1degreeF. Do NOT use ear thermometers.)\\t\\tTEST FIVE:\\tThis is the easiest home test for adrenal deficiency', ' from Wilson\\'s excellent 2001 book (still a classic) called \\\\\"Adrenal Fatigue\\\\\": all you need for this test is a ball point pen. Drag the dull end of a pen across your abdomen for about six inches (my guess would be about 2 fingers\\' width above or below your belly button) but don\\'t press overly hard or scratch the skin. If your adrenals are functioning normally or are only mildly affected', ' the mark will turn from white to red within about 10 seconds. If your adrenals are fatigued', ' however', \" the line will widen and stay white for about 2 minutes. This test isn't terribly accurate as it only shows up on about 40 per cent of people with low adrenal function. It generally tests positive only if the adrenal fatigue is fairly severe.\\t\\tThe outer cortex of our adrenal glands produces the hormones cortisol\", ' aldosterone', ' testosterone', ' DHEA', ' DHEAS', ' androstenedione and estrogens. Dysfunctional adrenals equates first to combined highs and lows of cortisol that are not normal', ' then to low cortisol (and sometimes low aldosterone as well as imbalances in other hormones). The Stop the Thyroid Madness website has much free practical information on adrenal issues as well as low thyroid. If you want a lab test', ' to confirm any self-test results', ' the most useful - and most accurate - is the 24-hour saliva test which is not very expensive (don\\'t let your doctor insist on the unreliable blood test or urine test).\"']\n",

Luckily, I did not pay for any of these books, so I can just be glad I read this one, and forget about the others.<p>In this book, Lerner treats anger as a signal that something is going wrong. She explains that only when we address the &quot;something wrong&quot; in a useful way will the anger go away. Then she explores the &quot;dances&quot; we engage in, in our attempts to make ourselves feel better. She suggests that most of our attempts to make ourselves feel better focus on the person(s) we think made us mad, rather than on ourselves. She compassionately and wisely shows how to disengage from the anger and the counter-productive patterns, while staying connected and acting with integrity. However, she also acknowledges the effect that this sort of change can have on other people in the dance, and she provides guidance in maintaining oneself in the face of countermoves. <p>Fundamentally, this is not the kind of self-help book that provides 10 easy steps to ridding oneself of anger.

JUDE ARNOLD\\tI was happy to find the eBook version of Dr. Lerner's 1970's classic.  I'm finding writing my first review of an eBook much more challenging, tho.  Dr. Lerner, a champion in women's psychology, offers us this awesome self help around anger.  I begin with the Epilogue in which Dr. Lerner talks about what she means by self help.\\t\\\\'Defining a self' or `becoming  one's  own person' is a task that one ultimately does alone....In the end\", ' I define what I think', ' feel and believe....Yet', ' this lonely and challenging task cannot be accomplished in isolation.  We can only accomplish it through our connectedness with others and the new learning about ourselves our relationships provide.\\\\\"(Italics and Underlining throughout are Dr. Lerner\\'s.)\\tIn her books Dr. Learner always stresses \\\\\"the importance of learning about the experience of family members and sharing our own.\\\\\"  She also adds her belief that it\\'s \\\\\"equally crucial for us to connect with the family of womankind....This book [is] about personal anger and personal change', ' but as feminism has taught us', \" `the personal is political.' This means that there is a circular connection between the patterns of our intimate relationships and the degree to which women are represented\", ' valued', ' and empowered in every aspect of society and culture....  \\\\\"It is not sufficient for individual women to learn to move differently in personal relationships.  If we do not also challenge and change the societal institutions that keep women in a subordinate and de-selfed position outside the home', ' what goes on inside the home will continue to be problematic for us all....Whether the problem we face is a marital battle or the escalating nuclear arms race', ' women and men both have a long legacy of blaming people rather than understanding patterns.  Our challenge is to listen carefully to our own anger and use it in the service of change - while we hold tight to all that is valuable in our female heritage and tradition.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner wrote The Dance of Anger \\\\\"to help readers not only identify the true sources of their anger', ' but also to learn how to change the patterns from which anger springs....The challenge of anger is at the heart of our struggle to achieve intimacy', ' self-esteem', ' and joy.  Learning how to deal with it is worth the journey', ' even though there are no six-easy-steps to personal fulfillment and relationship bliss.  The Dance of Anger teaches readers to understand how relationships operate and how to change our part in them.  It encourages readers to go the hard route.\\\\\"\\tAnger is a signal that \\\\\"can motivate us to say `no\\' to the ways in which we are defined by others and `yes\\' to the dictates of our inner self.  Women', ' however', ' have long been discouraged {and condemned} for the awareness and forthright expression of anger....The taboos against our feeling and expressing anger are so powerful that even knowing when we are angry is not a simple matter.  When a woman shows her anger', ' she is likely to be dismissed as irrational or worse....  \\\\\"Why are angry women so threatening to others?  If we are guilty', ' depressed', ' or self-doubting we stay in place.  We do not take action except against our own selves and we are unlikely to be agents of personal and social change.  In contrast', ' angry women may change and challenge the lives of us all', ' as witnessed by the past decade of feminism.\\\\\"  (I believe she refers', ' unfortunately', ' to the 1960\\'s here.)\\t\\\\\"Anger is something we feel.  It exists for a reason and always deserves our respect and attention.  We all have a right to everything we feel - and certainly our anger is no exception....Our anger signals a problem', ' but provides us with no answers - not even a clue - as to how to solve it.\\\\\"  Dr. Lerner does not however advocate venting anger or letting it all hang out.  \\\\\"Feelings of depression', ' low self-esteem', ' self-betrayal', ' and even self-hatred are inevitable when we fight but continue to submit to unfair circumstances', ' when we complain but live in a way that betrays our hopes', ' values and potentials....Those of us who are locked into ineffective expressions of anger suffer as deeply as those of us who dare not get angry at all.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner defines two styles of managing anger', ' the nice lady who avoids anger and conflict at all cost', ' and the bitch who is easily angered and fights with no constructive resolution.  In reality', ' both these styles \\\\\"serve equally well to protect others', ' to blur our clarity of self', \" and to ensure that change does not occur....Anger is inevitable when [nice ladies'] lives consist of giving in and going along; when we assume responsibility for other people's feelings and reactions; when we relinquish our primary responsibility to proceed with our own growth and ensure the quality of our own lives; when we behave as if having a relationship is more important than having a self....Nothing\", ' but nothing', ' will block the awareness of anger so effectively as guilt and self-doubt.  Our society cultivates guilt feelings in women such that many of us still feel guilty if we are anything less than an emotional service station to others.\\\\\"  On the other hand', ' the nature of the hysterical bitch\\'s \\\\\"fighting or angry accusations may actually allow the other person to get off the hook\\\\\" protecting old familiar patterns as surely as does silence.  The end result in both these styles is we end up feeling powerless.  Our self-esteem suffers because we have not addressed the real issues causing our anger.\\tIt is in our first family relationships that closeness often leads to stuckness.  Dr. Lerner teaches us to use our anger energy to get unstuck in our stickiest relationships first', ' so these same issues will not fuel the fires in all of our other relationships.  \\\\\"The ability to use anger as a tool for change requires that we gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of how relationships operate....unresolved issues from our past inevitably surface in our current relationships.\\\\\"  We simply must learn to use our anger to change our own patterns of relating rather than blame and try to change other people.\\tDr. Lerner identifies these four areas we need to learn to develop our skills and to use our anger as a tool for change in relationships:  \\\\\"1. We Can Learn to Tune In to the True Sources of Our Anger and Clarify Where We Stand.  \\\\\"2. We Can Learn Communications Skills.  \\\\\"3. We Can Learn to Observe and Interrupt Nonproductive Patterns of Interaction....We cannot make another person change his or her steps to an old dance', ' but if we change our own steps', ' the dance no longer can continue in the same predictable pattern.  \\\\\"4. We Can Learn to Anticipate and Deal with Countermoves and `Change Back!\\' Reactions from Others....In all families there is a powerful opposition to one member defining a more independent self...The powerful emotional counterforce (`You\\'re wrong\\'; `Change back!\\' `Or else....\\') is predictable', ' understandable', ' and to some extent', ' universal.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner adds', ' \\\\\"It is never easy to move away from silent submission or ineffective fighting toward a calm but firm assertion of who we are', ' where we stand', ' what we want', \" and what is and is not acceptable to us....Not only can we acquire new ways of managing old angers; we can also gain a clearer and stronger `I' and with it\", \" the capacity for a more intimate and gratifying `we.'  Many of our problems with anger occur when we choose between having a relationship and having a self.  This book is about having both.....If two people become one\", \" a separation can feel like a psychological or a physical death.  We may have nothing - not even a self to fall back on - when an important relationships ends.  We all need to have both an `I' and a `we' that nourish and give meaning to each other....The more we carve out a clear and separate `I'\", ' the more we can experience and enjoy both intimacy and aloneness.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner demonstrates that  all', ' and especially romantic', ' relationships can be like a seesaw; \\\\\"the underfunctioning of one individual allows for the overfunctioning of the other....The more the man [i.e.] avoids sharing his own weaknesses', ' neediness', ' and vulnerability', ' the more his woman may experience and express more than her share.  The more the woman avoids showing her competence and strength', ' the more her man will have an inflated sense of his own. And if the underfunctioning partner starts looking better', ' the overfunctioning partner will start looking worse....If the woman is further convinced that she herself cannot survive without the relationship', ' she will vent her anger in a manner that only reinforces the old familiar patterns from which her anger stems....  \\\\\"Whenever one person makes a move to rebalance the seesaw', \" there is a countermove by the other party.  There are few things more anxiety-arousing than shifting to a higher level of self-assertion and separateness in an important relationship and maintaining the position despite the countermoves of the other person....Countermoves are the other person's unconscious attempt to restore a relationship to its previous balance or equilibrium\", ' when anxiety about separateness and change gets too high....What matters is the degree to which we are able to take a clear position in a relationship and behave in ways that are congruent with our stated beliefs....The woman who sits at the bottom of a seesaw marriage accumulates a great amount of rage', ' which is in direct proportion to the degree of her submission and sacrifice....Sometimes', ' to develop a stronger `I\\' is to come to terms with our deep-seated wish to leave an unsatisfactory marriage and this possibility may be no less frightening than the fear of being left.\\\\\"\\tDr. Learners covers the subject of triangles in great depth. \\\\\"Identifying the real issues is not an easy matter.  It is particularly difficult among family members because when two adults have a conflict', ' they often bring in a third party to form a triangle', ' which then makes it even harder for the two people involved to identify and work out their problems.... Underground issues from one relationship or context invariably fuel our fires in another.\\\\\" We detour \\\\\"feelings of anger from one person to another....We reduce anxiety in one relationship by focusing on a third party', ' who we unconsciously pull into the situation to lower the emotional intensity in the original pair. Triangles can become rigidly entrenched blocking the growth of the individuals in them and keeping us from identifying the actual sources of conflict in our relationships....Triangles greatly increase the probability of escalating aggression....The three essential ingredients of extricating oneself from a triangle are: staying calm', ' staying out', ' and hanging in.\\\\\"  It is never helpful to anyone to gossip or talk about a third party. \\\\\"In the best of all possible worlds we might envision separate person-to-person relationships with our friends', ' coworkers', ' and family members that were not excessively influenced by other relationships.\\\\\"\\tMost of us put our anger energy into trying to change the other person.  This', ' Dr. Lerner repeatedly exclaims', ' is impossible.  We \\\\\"secretly believe that we have the corner on the `truth\\' and that this would be a much better world if everyone else believed and reacted exactly as we do.  But one of the hallmarks of emotional maturity is to recognize the validity of multiple realities and to understand that people think', ' feel', ' and react differently.\\\\\"  Closeness does not mean sameness.  \\\\\"We have a right to everything we think and feel - and so does everyone else.  It is our job to state our thoughts and feelings clearly and to make responsible decisions that are congruent with our values and beliefs.  It is not our job to make another person think and feel the way we do or the way we want them to.... We are able to move away from ineffective fighting only when we give up the fantasy that we can change or control another person. It is only then that we can reclaim the power that is truly ours - the power to change our own selves and take new and different actions on our own behalf.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner gives example after example illustrating these same basic lessons:  \\\\\"First', \" `letting it all hang out' may not be helpful because venting anger may protect rather than challenge the old rules and patterns in a relationship.  Second\", ' the only person we can change and control is our own self.  Third', ' changing our own self can feel so threatening and difficult that it is often easier to continue an old pattern of silent withdrawal or ineffective fighting and blaming.  And', ' finally', ' de-selfing is at the heart of our most serious anger problems.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Even rats in a maze learn to vary their behavior if they keep hitting a dead end.  Why in the world', ' then', ' do we behave less intelligently than laboratory animals?  Repeating the same old fights protects us from the anxieties we are bound to experience when we make a change....Human nature is such that when we are angry', ' we tend to become so emotionally reactive to what the other person is doing to us that we lose our ability to observe our own part in the interaction....Self-observation is the process of seeing the interaction of ourselves and others', ' and recognizing that the ways other people behave with us has something to do with the way we behave with them.\\\\\"  The form of this circular dance is universal in which the behavior of each serves \\\\\"to maintain and provoke the other.  Once a part of an established twosome - married or unmarried', ' lesbian or straight - the more each person tries to change things', ' the more things stay the same.\\\\\"\\tI am beginning to understand how my interaction had become a circular dance in which my behavior maintained and provoked behavior in my significant other.  \\\\\"In the final analysis it matters little who started it.... A good way to make this break is to recognize the part we play in maintaining and provoking the other person\\'s behavior.  Even if we are convinced that the other person is ninety-seven percent to blame we are still in control of changing our three percent.\\\\\"  Bottom line - \\\\\"We do not have the power to change another person who does not want to change', ' and our attempts to do so may actually protect him or her from change.  This is the paradox of the circular dances in which we all participate.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Opposites do attract', ' but they do not always live happily ever after.  On the one hand', \" it is reassuring to live with someone who will express parts of one's own self that one is afraid to acknowledge; yet\", \" the arrangement has its inevitable costs:  The woman [i.e.]who is expressing feelings not only for herself but also for her husband will indeed end up behaving `hysterically' and `irrationally.'  The man who relies on his wife to do the `feeling work' for him will increasingly lose touch with this important part of himself\", ' \\\\\"and when the time comes that he needs to draw upon his emotional resources', \" he may find that nobody's at home....This is the `masculinity' that our society breeds - the male who feels at home in the world of things and abstract ideas but who has little empathic connection to others \", ' little attunement to his own internal world', \" and little willingness or capacity to `hang in' when a relationship becomes conflicted and stressful... . Doing the `feeling work' like cleaning up has long been defined as `woman's work'\", ' and lots of women are good at it.  As with cleaning up', ' men will not begin to do their shares until women no longer do it for them.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"When a woman vents her anger ineffectively or expresses it in an overemotional style', ' she does not threaten her man.  If anything she helps him maintain his masculine cool', ' while she herself is perceived as infantile or irrational.  When a woman clarifies the issue and uses her anger to move toward something new and different', ' the change occurs.  If she stops over-functioning [overinvolvement] for others and starts acting for herself', ' her underfunctioning [underinvolvement] man is likely to acknowledge and deal with his own anxieties.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner goes on to identify two other types of dancers:  \\\\\"Emotional pursuers are persons who reduce their anxiety by sharing feelings and seeking close emotional contact.  Emotional distancers are persons who reduce their anxiety by intellectualizing and withdrawing.\\\\\"  No matter the problem', ' these two styles of responding to stress eventually become at odds. The common outcome of this classic scenario is that \\\\\"after the escalating dance of pursuit and withdrawal proceeds for some time', \" the woman [most often the pursuer] goes into what therapists call `reactive distance'\", \" which only temporarily reverses the pursuit cycle or has little effect at all....When a pursuer stops pursuing and begins to put her energy back into her own life - without distancing or expressing anger at the other person - the circular dance has been broken....A relationship becomes more `true' and balanced as the pursuer can allow herself to acknowledge and express more of her own wish for independence and space\", ' and in turn', ' the distancer can begin to acknowledge more of his dependency and wish for closeness.\\\\\"\\tShe repeats again', ' \\\\\"Changing another person is a solution that never', ' ever works.\\\\\"  The power that is ours is only and always the power to change our own self.  The only real power we have is the power to act and make choices.  However', ' to try to change the other person is usually the first thing we do with our anger.  The second thing we do is cut ourselves off either emotionally or geographically.  Such distancing does bring short-term relief but there are long term costs - \\\\\"the unresolved emotional intensity is likely to get played out in other important relationships....When emotional intensity is high in a family', ' most of us put the entire responsibility for poor communication on the other person....Always', ' we perceive that it is the other who prevents us from speaking and keeps the relationship from changing.  We disown our own part in the interactions we complain of and', ' with it', ' our power to bring about a change.\\\\\"\\tOK! What do we do instead of trying to change the other person or their thoughts and feelings?  We clearly state our beliefs and convictions and we stand behind them. This includes identifying within ourselves the true source of our anger', ' usually our independence from that person.  As we become less scared and guilty about showing our own strong and separate selves', ' in a mature and responsible fashion', ' we become more ready to make a change in the relationship', ' a change to being a separate and different person with our own unique way of being in the world.  With this change comes the experience of separation anxiety', ' most often \\\\\"based on an underlying discomfort with separateness and individuality that has its roots in our early family experience', ' where the unspoken expectation may have been that we keep a lid on our expressions of self.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Hit and Run confrontation does not lead to lasting change.... If serious about change', ' she must show for her own sake as well as the other that at last she is declaring her separateness and independence', ' but she is not declaring a lack of caring or closeness.  Independence means that we clearly define our own selves on emotionally important issues', ' but it does not mean emotional distance....The work of negotiating greater independence may be so fraught with mutual anxieties about rejection and loss that the person making the move must be responsible for maintaining emotional contact with the other.\\\\\"  Success will rest on her ability to share something about herself in a straightforward', ' nonblaming way while maintaining emotional contact throughout the process.  It requires also that she \\\\\"uphold her position with persistence and calm', \" without getting emotionally buffeted about by the inevitable countermoves and `change back!' reactions we meet whenever we assume a more autonomous position in an important relationship. This is what achieving selfhood and independence is all about. And it requires\", ' among other things a particular way of talking and a degree of clarity that are especially difficult to achieve when we are angry.\\\\\"\\tAnother important technique that Dr. Lerner teaches is to turn anger into an \\\\\"I message', '\\\\\" a nonblaming statement about one\\'s own self. She emphasizes that \\\\\"if our goal is to break a pattern in an important relationship and/or to develop a strong sense of self that we can bring to all our relationships', ' it is essential that we learn to translate our anger into clear', \" nonblaming statements about our own self .... The significant issue for women is that we may not have a clear `I' to communicate about and we are not prepared to handle the intense negative reactions that come our way when we do begin  to define and assert the self....Women often fear that having a clear `I' means threatening a relationship or losing an important person.  Thus\", \" rather than using our anger as a challenge to think more clearly about the `I' in our relationships we may\", ' when angry', ' actually blur what personal clarity we do have.\\\\\"\\tWe really fear rocking the boat.  \\\\\"Feeling fuzzy-headed', ' inarticulate', ' and not so smart are common reactions experienced by women as we struggle to take a stand on our own behalf.  It is not just anger and fighting that we learn to fear; we avoid asking precise questions and making clear statements when we unconsciously suspect that doing so would expose our differences', ' make the other person feel uncomfortable', ' and leave us standing alone.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Why would any of us attempt to deny our anger and sacrifice one of our most precious possessions - our personal clarity?\\\\\"  For one thing', ' \\\\\"our very definitions of `masculinity\\' and `femininity\\' are based on the notion that women must function as nonthreatening helpmates and ego builders to men lest men feel castrated and weakened.\\\\\"  This explains when a woman\\'s anger turns to tears; she\\'s attempting to restore togetherness.  Instead she probably needs to work harder at the task of clarifying her separateness and independence within her first family. She cannot control the other person\\'s reaction.  She should not allow herself to be controlled by them either.  \\\\\"She can simply stay on course by listening to what they have to say and then restating her initial position. There is nothing wrong with \\\\\"sounding like a broken record now and then.... She cannot change the other person\\'s mind or ensure that justice will prevail.  She can state her position', ' recognize her choices', ' and make responsible decisions on her own behalf.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Our problem is not the fear of clarity but the absence of it.  That we are angry is obvious.  But we may have little perspective on the `I', \"' as a result of focusing exclusively on what the other person is doing to us.... Using our anger as a starting point to become more knowledgeable about the self does not require that we analyze ourselves and provide lengthy psychologically explanations of our reactions....Anger is a tool for change when it challenges us to become more of an expert on the self and less of an expert on others.  Learning to use our anger effectively requires some letting go - letting go of blaming that other person whom we see as causing our problems and failing to provide for our happiness; letting go of the notion that it is our job to change other people or tell them how they should think\", ' feel', ' behave. Yet', ' this does not mean that we passively accept or go along with any behavior.  In fact', \" a `live-and-let-live' attitude can signal a de-selfed position\", ' if we fail to clarify what is and is not acceptable or desirable to us in a relationship.  The main issue is how we clarify our position....We can simply say', ' `well', ' it may seem crazy or irrational to you', \" but this is the way I see it.'  Of course\", ' there is never a guarantee that other people will alter their behavior\\\\\" to suit you and me.\\tDr. Lerner also counsels to not be in a hurry with this.  It\\'s ok to be uncertain.  Sit with it for a while!  She says', ' \\\\\"Slow Down!  Our anger can be a powerful vehicle for personal growth and change if it does nothing more than help us recognize that we are not yet clear about something.\\\\\"  What most of us do when we are angry is judge', ' blame', ' criticize', ' moralize', ' preach', ' instruct', ' interpret', ' and psychoanalyze. She goes on to say', ' \\\\\"If I persist in repeating this point', ' it is because it is an extremely difficult concept to grasp', ' and hold on to when we are angry.  Conflicting wants and different perceptions of the world do not mean that one party is `right\\' and the other `wrong.\\'\\\\\"\\tSome common communication mistakes we make are', ' for starters \\\\\"not being particularly tactful and strategic.  Few people are able to listen well when they are being criticized or told what\\'s wrong with them.\\\\\"  Second', ' we communicate as if to convey that we are an expert on the other person\\'s experience.  \\\\\"\\'Who has the problem?\\' is a question that has nothing to do with guilt or culpability.  The one who has the problem is simply the party who is dissatisfied with or troubled by the particular situation....How many of us can distinguish with confidence where our responsibilities to others begin and end? How can women trained from birth to define ourselves through our loving care of others - know with confidence when it is time to finally say `Enough!\\'?\\\\\" Many woman devote themselves so exclusively to the needs of others that they betray if not lose themselves.\\t\\\\\"If however', \" we do not use our anger to define ourselves clearly in every important relationship we are in - and manage our feelings as they arise - no one else will assume this responsibility for us.  We are never the first in our family to wrestle with a problem although it may feel that way.  All of us inherit the unsolved problems of our past....We put our energy into taking responsibility for other people's feelings\", ' thoughts and behavior and hand  over to others responsibility for our own. When this happens', ' it becomes difficult', ' if not impossible for the old rules of a relationship to change....As we learn to \\\\\"relinquish responsibility for the self', ' we are prone to blame others for failing to fill up our emptiness or provide for our happiness - which is not their job.\\\\\"  It is however our job to \\\\\"allow others the space to manage their own pain and solve their own problems. When we do not put our primary emotional energy into solving our own problems', \" we take on other people's problems as our own.  When we overfunction for another individual\", ' we end up very angry and in the process', ' we facilitate the growth of no one.\\\\\"  We must \\\\\"acknowledge that we do not have the answers or solutions to other people\\'s problems.\\\\\" Even with children', ' \\\\\"Change comes about when we stop trying to shape up the other person and begin to observe patterns and find new options for our own behavior.\\\\\"\\tIn closing', \" I'd like to thank Dr. Lerner for her tremendous contribution to women's psychology and my emotional health\", ' and for this \\\\\"review of some basic do\\'s and don\\'ts to keep in mind when you are feeling angry.  \\\\\"1.

The other are two books,[by other authors]... Freyre, the most popular and readable of the three, was a Pernambucano (from the sugar cane regions around Recife) and often blurs the distinction between Brazil as a whole and sugar-cane regions of Brazil. His methodology reflects his education, a US oriented 1930\\'s anthropological perspective (he was a student of Franz Boas). This book in particular treats a very specific historical event: the development of a sugar-based agricultural economy in late 1500s, early 1600s in northeastern coastal Brazil. The book makes the generalization that Brazilian culture as a whole evolved from this cultural base, and places little importance on the parallel development of cattle-based cultures in the northeastern interior or the primitive jungle trading activities of Sao Paulo\\'s city fathers (Raposo Tavares, etc). <p>Because of its focus on a very provincial-specific economy and culture, I would criticize Freyre for offering a very incomplete study of \\\\Brazilian Civilization\\\\\" in this book. In his defense', ' however', ' this book is too often read as a stand-alone study', ' when in fact Freyre intended for it to form a trilogy with another two books...The former traces how the rural sugar-based culture of early northeastern Brazil affected and was affected by the emergence of cities and urban life-patterns in places like Recife', ' Salvador', ' and Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1600s through the end of the 18th century. The latter book follows the study further', ' through the independence period and especially the twilight of the Empire', \" establishment of the Republic in the 188o's. If you read one\", \" I recommend all three books to appreciate Freyre's thesis\", \" that the original sugar-culture that developed and was discussed in Masters and Slaves had a lasting impact on Brazil's evolution as a whole\", ' even in areas and regions where sugar cane and slavery were never established bases for economic development.

Laidman recognized, we can't look for his work as if it's been written yesterday: when many people all over Americas (both North and South) believed that &quot;whitening population&quot; was the solution to all problems; when fascists and nazis took power in Europe, Freyre looked at mixture of races and saw it as a positive feature, something that could lead our people to a better place, God knows where, but better. During the 60's and 70's his ideas were fiercely attacked by new generations of sociologists and historians - and that's good, that's how science advances. But, they attacked him, mostly, for his political positions. Today, people rediscovered Freyre, understood him on his own time. Yes, his presumptions about sex addicted people, indian women burning in desire and so on are considered today too much. But the essence, the mix of races and cultures as a positive fact, the understanding of Portuguese government as something absent and masters of plantions, on the absence of State, rulling their slaves and families and regions, masters as the actual power in colonial Brazil, is considered a remarkable way to understand our country and it's people.

Portuguese men are categorized as  oversexed (over and over again), Amerindian women as ever willing sexual  partners while the Africans are determined to be less sexual because they  use music and dancing to stimulate their sexual urges (!).

        "['10.1086/654745', 'Eros and Civilization', '0807015555', \"So I'm the first one to tackle this one ?!? So be it: first published in 1955, &quot;Eros&quot; is a cornerstone of modern sociopolitical philosophy. It's a radical work, in the sense that Marcuse goes back to the  roots and undertakes the task of carrying Freudian theory to its  inescapable implications. (A task, by the way, set down by Herr Doktor  Professor himself; if your edition of the Britannica still has the text  originally written by Freud in 1926 for the &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;  entry, check out his statement that &quot;the future will probably  attribute far greater importance to psychoanalysis as the science of the  unconscious than as a therapeutic procedure&quot;.) As all true  masterpieces, &quot;Eros&quot; is not flawless: in the latter part of the  book, Marcuse falls into the trap of trying to describe / prescribe how a  society freed from repression would organize itself for the common good,  rather than self-destructing - and, of course, fumbles royally (a failure  he admitted to in his later works). No matter; unless you've read it,  you're like Dylan's Mr. Jones, and will have no inkling on how (and, most  importantly, why) capitalism reinvented itself from industrial back into  financial, much less on what the current &quot;global crisis&quot; is all  about. I dare suggest that &quot;Eros&quot; be read back-to-back with  Christopher Lasch's &quot;The Culture of Narcissism&quot;. In a strange  way, they complement each other\"]\n",
        "['10.1086/654745', 'Eros and Civilization', '0807015555', 'Herbert Marcuse\\'s \\'Eros and Civilization\\' is emblematic of the aspect of his work that integrates Freudian theory with Marxian doctrine. Although he primarily deals with Freud and the issue of society\\'s use of repression (psychological and political) in the service of production, he deals with Marxist theory also when you read between the lines. The theme of alienation of labor is clearly one of the resounding and recurring notes in the symphony.\\tAs a psychotherapist intimately acquainted with developments in psychoanalytic theory in the fifty odd years since Marcuse wrote, this project involves some perils as well as some rich veins of thought. To philosophize on the basis of a theory which is derived primarily from clinical work in which two individuals share in a closed setting is always dangerous. In addition, to take Freud\\'s formulations for granted, and then proceed to apply them to social and political systems is a big stretch. I would say primarily that the main flaw in Marcuse\\'s thesis is his acceptance of Thanatos, or the so-called death principle, which is no longer accepted by any school of psychoanalysis. Unfortunately, Freud\\'s own tendency to speculate both in the fields of anthropology and metaphysics, does not help Marcuse any. If one studies Talcott Parsons and his brilliant work on social systems (The Social System) using social theory, one can see a great deal of resonance with Marcuse\\'s analysis of repression as a cultural control mechanism.\\tTo balance the equation, I believe Marcuse brings to surface themes which have been abandoned in modern social discourse through sheer inertia and the grinding power of the repressive culture. The description of the  role the inner agencies (i.e. the superego) play in integrating an individual into a particular society is a brilliant analysis. If our culture seemed \\\\successful\\\\\" as a consumer society then', ' the movement has only expanded to the point the culture in general has lost sight of how our citizens are enslaved by the very \\\\\"American dream\\\\\" we tell ourselves will bring happiness. The concept of an infinitely expanding economy', \" the measurement of the nation's well being by primarily economic and political indicators\", ' the military displacement of aggression to an outside \\\\\"evil\\\\\" enemy', ' the frenzied pursuit of built-in obsolence have all metastasized', ' and Marcuse has put them to the microscope.\\tI would say that at a time when our country is having a resurgence of hope', \" Marcuse's work offers a very important analytic tool with which think about where we are and where we want to go as a people\", ' and a void re-creating excessively repressive social structures.\"']\n",

But the damage is done: once you read this book Freud's idea that repression is salutary and necessary for psychic development will look a lot more like what it was(late Victorian moralism) and much less like what it wasn't (science).

That is what you get with &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science &amp; Medicine&quot;.  Not only do you read about the great advances in medicine but also about the mistakes that were made along the way.  Although the book was written with the first year medical student in mind it is easy enough to read and understand by those with only a passing knowledge of basic first aid.  Perhaps one sentence from the Forward best describes the writing style - &quot;...it has been written to be read, rather than studied.&quot;  <p>Dr. Kennedy states that this book was not widely accepted by the academic presses and so was published independently.  It is fairly obvious that one of the reasons this might be the case is his candid examination of the history of medicine.  In an age when most practitioners of the medical profession seem to feel that they have perfect knowledge, Dr. Kennedy's book shows that they have often been wrong with tragic results.  Take for instance the case of Ignaz Semmelweiss who worked in a hospital where there was a twenty-nine percent mortality rate for women giving birth.  Through experimentation and deduction he came to believe that washing your hands between patients and after autopsies would cause this rate to drop.  He ordered that hand washing would be done between patients and the rate of death dropped drastically.  However, since he had not reason why it worked it was resisted, he eventually resigned (other historians have noted that he was forced to resign) and the doctors returned to their old habits and the old mortality rate.  After all it made no sense to them that something they could not see could make any difference.  Many people will immediately see the similarities between things like this and modern attitude of medical science as related to alternative therapies - if we don't yet understand how it works then it must not work.  Most medical history texts are severely sanitized to keep such historical errors out.  So, it is really no surprise that this book, which portrays history as it was, from many primary sources, is not the most popular one among the medical establishment.<p>Personally, I enjoyed the book but I am one of those who enjoys history from a viewpoint of accuracy - warts and all.  Still you should be prepared to have some of your history that you learned in high school discredited.  I remember learning that Louis Pasteur invented innoculations to prevent disease in the later 1800's, but the fact is that Charles Maitland and others were doing it in the 1700's.  &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the history and progression of medicine.\"]\n",
        "['10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'Medical History', '0974946656', \"This is both an extremely ambitious and enormously entertaining history of the development of the medical treatment of human beings throughout the ages. It is ambitious in that the author attempts to survey the field from prehistory until the present day, and to do so in less than five hundred pages. The scope means that at times things of necessity have to be left out. For instance, the great story in science as a whole (and in medicine in particular) between classical antiquity and the early 17th century is the growth and eventual downfall of Aristotelianism, which provided the scientific background for nearly every branch of scientific endeavor during that time. Many of the key events of that story are briefly recounted, but many are not (e.g., allied discoveries by Galileo in astronomy that refuted Aristotelian assumptions). Still, given the limitations of space, this is an admirable treatment of the subject. To deal with every issue comprehensibly would have expanded dramatically the size of the book, which would have given the lie to the title. My one serious objection to the book is that the book does not have an overarching narrative structure. I'm not always sure what particular story is being told. Nonetheless, it is impossible to come away from the book without a far deeper appreciation for the remarkable journey medicine has undertaken over the centuries. It also makes me enormously grateful that I am alive today, and not in some previous century.<p>Above all, this is a fun, engaging, thoroughly entertaining book. Although the book sometimes veers towards the encyclopedic, the style at all times is anecdotal. The author loves his subject, and especially delights in the quirkier side of things. There are mountains of fascinating trivia, and as a lover of great trivia I was constantly saying to myself, &quot;Wow, I didn't know that!&quot; Some of the more fascinating bits of the book are when Kennedy discusses famous individuals and the way in which disease may have affected them, such as Ivan the Terrible or Henry VIII. Even in modern medical discoveries, he has an eye for the unusual.<p>This is also, however, a very educational book. The amount of information contained in its pages is fairly staggering. One great use for the book is to read through the sections on a particular epoch if one is engaged in historical reading. But the book is more than a collection of interesting facts. The reader gains an appreciation for the way that medical practice has developed over the centuries. For instance, Kennedy discusses how before the invention of anesthesia speed was a highly esteemed virtue in a surgeon. Surgery was performed quickly, and as a result there was less of an emphasis on working carefully and carefully suturing. But with the development of anesthesia, surgery slowed down, and surgeons took more care to operate with great care and to minimize injury to tissue. This is merely one random example out of thousands.<p>One of the most appealing aspects of the book is the deeply personal style of the author. Closely aligned with his love of the anecdotes and trivia is his eye for the humorous side of things. He also writes with a personal touch. In discussing some medical condition, he will mention that he had had such a case himself at such and such a point, or that someone had devised a form of pediatric surgery, and he later had as a patient the second recipient ever of that treatment. Or he will mention that his mother's uncle had a certain medical condition, or aunt was a nurse for a famous doctor.<p>This truly is a book suited for a variety of audiences. I have a strong interest in history, and as a result I enjoyed most the first half, in part because I had the background to understand everything there pretty easily. I struggled a bit more in the second half as medicine became more specialized, but I imagine that this half would be of greater interest to medical students or physicians. The main thing that I want to emphasize is that both the medical student and the educated nonspecialist will equally find much to enjoy in the book. Similarly, one could also employ the book merely as a reference work, or read it several chapters at a time. It is rare, however, that a book can be so educational over such a wide-ranging subject, and entertain so thoroughly at the same time.\"]\n",

There are enough very specific insights to give a medical expert a few pleasant doubletakes, as well as to introduce the layman to how we reached our current views.\\t  There were times that I wanted more detail on a technical topic, but isn't it traditional for the great storytellers to leave you hanging, wanting more?\\t  The author doesn't ignore that medicine always exists in a social and technical context.  Religion has both suppressed and enhanced medical knowledge, and he presents both ends of the spectrum.  Anyone who gets into the real world of hospitals, to say nothing of academic research, learns very quickly of the profusion of enormous egos -- and the politics resulting from them. While people may be pictured smiling as they receive Nobel Prizes, quite a number were suppressing rage at their co-awardees, or feeling terrible because their collaborator wasn't up there as well.\\t  In modern times, more general financial and political interests have a great deal to do with the practice of medicine.

Before that time, while there were some people who critically examined techniques of treatment, most medical practitioners did more harm than good.  At best, the treatment did no harm and there was tremendous resistance by the medical profession to change, even when the benefit was clearly demonstrated. Many women died in childbirth due to infections caused by doctors going directly from dissecting cadavers to delivering babies without washing their hands. It was not until sometime in the twentieth century before it could be said that the medical profession had alleviated more suffering than it caused.\\t This book chronicles all of this and is one of best written histories that I have encountered, independent of subject. It all starts in the first few pages, where you learn that early humans who were hunter-gatherers did not suffer from many acute diseases. After populations spent generations in the same general area, most diseases had adapted to being chronic in nature. Few people died from those diseases and new ones were rarely introduced into the population.\\t Three things, leading to the rise of civilization, changed that. The first was the domestication of animals, which allowed for the trans-species migration of diseases. This was a bit of a surprise to me, although it should not have been. The modern and deadly diseases of AIDS and Ebola are both caused by viruses that have migrated from other primates. As I write this, countries in Asia are killing enormous numbers of chickens in an attempt to prevent a disease virus from moving from chickens to humans.\\t  The second event was the development of agriculture, which required stationary populations, and allowed the numbers to grow dramatically. This led to the profession of civil engineering and how to provide potable water and dispose of waste. Until recently, this has been a chronic problem and many epidemics have been due to contaminated water.\\t The third event is the increased mobility of populations, which is a more recent event. Strains of diseases that are chronic and mild in one population due to generations of acquired immunity become plagues when introduced to new populations. So much of the history of the world has been shaped by disease, which is one of the primary themes explained in detail. The Europeans gave the Americas smallpox and the Americans gave the Europeans syphilis.  Asia gave Europe the bubonic plague, and Africa gave the world AIDS. I was very impressed with how Kennedy describes these events and explains how they changed the world.\\t Some of the most fascinating historical accounts dealt with individuals. The Russian Czar known as Ivan the Terrible was not always so terrible. In the early years of his reign, he was very enlightened, establishing schools and a legal code. However, in his later years, he earned his historical moniker, even killing his own son. His body was exhumed in the years of Soviet rule and it showed clear evidence of tertiary syphilis. Therefore, the insanity of his last years and the devastating consequences for Russian history were most likely due to his suffering from advanced syphilis. Although not proven, there are strong indications that Henry VIII of England also suffered from tertiary syphilis, which can explain some of the erratic behavior in his later years. One cannot help but be astonished at the rates of syphilitic infection in Europe a short time after it was brought back by the early explorers of the Americas. In 1599, one-third of the inhabitants of Paris were infected with syphilis. Given that it is transmitted primarily by sexual contact, this figure is incredible. It also indicates how sexually promiscuous the Parisians had to be and points out that there were times in history where people were more sexually promiscuous than they are now.\\t  One cannot help but be astonished by the resistance to change that has pervaded the medical profession throughout its existence. It would be hard to find any other group of people who have exhibited such a conservative mindset for so long. In some ways, the only place where similar mindsets can be found is in religion. On the personal side, Kennedy occasionally refers to events in his life. There are not many, but they are expressed in a very matter of fact manner. It is unusual to read something like, \\\\I was there when we tried . . .  .', ' the patient died.\\\\\"\\t This book is a real riveting page-turner.

This has resulted in less emphasis on the learning of the skills of the time honored Doctor-Patient relationship and in creating the aura that physicians dwell in glass dome sanctuaries of science: the quiet moments of sharing personal fears and concerns and relieving the pain in the souls of the patient and patients' families seem relics of the past house-call/caring-physician image.

This has resulted in less emphasis on the learning of the skills of the time honored Doctor-Patient relationship and in creating the aura that physicians dwell in glass dome sanctuaries of science: the quiet moments of sharing personal fears and concerns and relieving the pain in the souls of the patient and patients' families seem relics of the past house-call/caring-physician image.\\t\\tMichael Kennedy in his book A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISEASE, SCIENCE & MEDICINE has done more to rectify this widening gap between physician and patient than any volume I have read. This meticulously written, dignified yet very warm and honest look at medicine from the Ice Age to the era of molecular and genetic concepts for the present and the future reads more like a fascinating novel than an academic treatise. There are facts and histories discussed here which will enlighten not only the general public but also the men and women of medicine - from premed student to retired doctor. It is simply an amazing source of knowledge while simultaneously being an honest, no-holds-barred review of how we came to this point in healthcare. And if ever there were a time when this book was needed, it is certainly now. Read this fascinating tome and learn not only the extraordinary progress made in the mystery of disease and physical meanderings away from the 'normal', but at the same time see just how vulnerable is the scientist and physician in dealing with new aspects of the art of practicing medicine through time.\\t\\tKennedy and his colleagues have added an important adjunct to the re-entry of humanism in the teaching of medicine at his alma mater: this book demonstrates that journey of commitment to resurrect the precious healing relationship between the doctor and those who approach him for succor. Read this book for a highly dignified history of medicine, for some amazing insights into disease process, and for reassurance the perhaps the return of the sanctity of healthcare delivery is a possibility.

The sub-genre of the Gothic, embodied by novels containing countless instances of incestuous and homosocial relationships, not only invites, but demands the attention of a queer eye.  However, following the winding, subterraneous paths of a queer reading can be a daunting task, especially for the budding scholar of the Gothic.  One needs to be able to take into account the complex theories of foundational critics such as Freud, Foucault, Sedgwick, and Butler in order to recognize the impact queer themes and relationships might have on the reading of gothic fiction.  Unpacking the latent intricacies in the Gothic involves discerning what these queer themes are saying about the texts\\' crucial scenes.  Without a consideration of a queer reading, the Gothic loses one of its fundamental sources of influence and significance.  Consequently, the reader\\'s experience with the Gothic would prove disingenuous and wanting.\\t\\t  Thankfully, the canon of gothic criticism has George Haggerty, Professor of English at The University of California, Riverside, to shine an insightful light on its queer avenues.  Haggerty\\'s 2006 book, Queer Gothic, offers a comprehensive, yet in-depth examination of queer elements throughout the Gothic.  Haggerty introduces this text as \\\\the culmination of a career in gothic fiction\\\\\" (ix). It should be noted that Haggerty\\'s is an impressive', ' prolific career that includes earlier books Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form (1989)', ' Unnatural Affections: Women and Fiction in the Later 18th Century (1998)', ' and Men in Love (1999)', ' as well as numerous scholarly journal publications.\\t\\t  Haggerty begins his study with the first appearance of gothic text', \" Walpole's The Castle of Otranto\", ' and traces the development of the Gothic across time and genre', \" concluding the work with an examination of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.  At each stop on his book's nine-chapter tour\", ' Haggerty walks the reader through a close reading of queer elements at work in an average of three to four different gothic texts.  The author has divided the nine chapters into three three-chapter parts: \\\\\"Gothic Sexuality', '\\\\\" \\\\\"Gothic Culture', '\\\\\" and \\\\\"Gothic Fictions and the Queering of Culture.\\\\\"  Exploring eighteenth-century gothic fiction', ' moving to gothic drama', ' and eventually jumping the pond to consider twentieth-century American gothic offspring', \" Haggerty demonstrates the cultural impacts the Gothic's queer elements have had across history.\\t\\t  In his introduction\", ' Haggerty offers an overview and explanation of the three sections of his study and places himself within the current body of gothic criticism: \\\\\"I imagine this book as a gathering of analyses that together make an important point about the ways in which gothic fiction anticipates the history of sexuality and gives that history its most basic materials\\\\\" (5).  With this purpose in mind', ' Haggerty quickly asserts the existence and value of a gothic-queer connection.  In his first chapter', ' Haggerty explains that a queer reading \\\\\"can begin to show the ways in which gothic works beyond the limits of its structural `meaning\\' to change the structure of meaning itself.  Gothic fiction is about reaching into some undefinable world beyond fictional reality. . . That is why gothic fiction remains as queer as it is', ' and it also suggests why and how gothic remains to challenge the status quo and at the same time to expand its purview\\\\\" (10).  With this understanding in mind', \" Haggerty begins an exploration of the ways various texts in the gothic canon subvert the heteronormative assumptions of their day.\\t\\t  The author devotes significant attention to describing how classic gothic texts lend themselves to a queer reading.  Drawing on the gender bending and incestuous violence in Matthew Lewis's The Monk\", \" the eyebrow-raising mother-daughter relations in Ann Radcliffe's novels\", \" and the reverse Oedipal pattern in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto\", ' Haggerty makes a strong case for queer themes at work in the Gothic since its inception.  And he accomplishes all of this with a tone that is two parts scholarly', ' one part cheeky.  Who would not enjoy reading a text containing such chapter subtitles as \\\\\"Poor Conrad\\\\\" (Walpole lovers delight!) and \\\\\"Mothers and Other Lovers\\\\\" (21', ' 30)?\\t\\t If any caution is to be offered when approaching Queer Gothic', ' it is to set aside time for background reading.  In an effort to ground his study', ' Haggerty refers frequently to several key theorists and present-day scholars.  Judith Butler and Michel Foucault both exercise influence over the study', ' as do studies by David Halperin', ' David Punter', ' Cynthia Griffin Wolff', ' and Nina Auerbach.  This support system of authorities acts as a double-edged sword', ' providing a deeper', \" more credible basis for Haggerty's arguments\", ' while simultaneously making portions of the text especially challenging for any newbies to the gothic arena.  On a related note', ' those less familiar (or concerned) with the modern incarnations of the Gothic may find the latter chapters difficult.  Thankfully', ' each part', ' if not each chapter', ' successfully stands on its own as an individual study', ' permitting some jumping around on the part of the reader.\\t\\t On the whole', \" Haggerty's study proves to be a challenging and rewarding read that offers its audience an enlightening and\", ' at times', ' humorous journey through the queer world of gothic texts.\"']\n",

When individuals and cultures clash on questions of how to act and what is important, it can seem impossible to adjudicate between them without simply taking sides.  This is especially true when it becomes clear that both sides make sense, at least on their own terms, given the history and context out of which they arose.\\t\\tAppiah uses examples drawn from his own experience growing up in Ghana, and brings to bear ideas drawn from a range of sources, in an attempt to carve out a middle ground between \\\\dogmatic universalism\\\\\" (the view that there is one right way to live and other ways are wrong) and \\\\\"skeptical relativism\\\\\" (that suggests anything goes and every worldview and set of practices is as right', ' or wrongheaded', ' as any other).  One attractive possibility is to find at least common grounds for adjudicating disputes', ' under the assumption that where we can\\'t agree regarding the ultimate values that inform our actions we might be able to agree to accept a common tribunal.  This agreement to accept a \\\\\"higher power\\\\\" that adjudicates disputes can be rooted in the Hobbesian motive of self-preservation: i.e. we might see that it is in our interest to submit to the decisions of governing bodies because otherwise we are likely to kill each other.  But if that was all there were', ' there would be no reason for a stronger people or nation to accept the rulings of these bodies when they have the power to overcome disputes by force.\\t\\tThe argument here is that there needs to be something more than self-interest motivating our agreement to disagree peaceably', ' and to find ways of adjudicating disputes without resorting to violence.  This \\\\\"something more\\\\\" is what Appiah calls \\\\\"cosmopolitanism\\\\\" - a kind of attitude of respect for and interest in differences.  It involves', ' as he sees it', ' an extension of sympathies from the local to the global', ' but always in particular ways.  I can never know enough to care about everyone except in the most abstract and general way', ' but knowing enough about some culture other than my own to appreciate their ways and see them on their own terms', ' can help at least to minimize the strangeness of other cultures I have so far not understood.

Taking  as his starting point the writings of Diogenes, the 4th century Greek Cynic philosopher, Appiah develops a philosophy of cosmopolitanism modeled on Diogenes\\' \\\\citizen of the world.\\\\\"  A citizen of the world regards the individual rather than family', ' tribe', ' or nation as the primary focus of ethical agency.  And that it is important to recognize that individuals are bound by belief systems and cultures that are not only different but may also be opposed to their own.  Cosmopolitanism is an ethics somewhere between relativism and universalism that can build a working relationship between adherents of different belief systems enabling coexistance but not necessarily agreement.\\t\\tThis is not as easy as it sounds; in fact', \" it doesn't even sound easy.  Cosmopolitanism is\", ' in addition to Diogenes legacy', ' a product of the Enlightenment in that it celebrates diversity and multiculturalism; it is tolerant of diverse moralities.  However', ' it is intolerant of those who would deny tolerance of this diversity or plurality.  This is the central dilemma of cosmopolitanism.  It attempts to reconcile liberal universal values with the values of those who disagree with them.  Cosmopolitanism believes in the basic freedoms', ' including freedom of speech but it will curb any speech that calls for restricting that freedom.\\t\\tThis dilemma is currently playing itself out worldwide with the publication in a Danish newspaper cartoons depicting Mohammed.  Denmark is a quintessential liberal country and regards mocking belief systems as a basic human right.  On the other hand', ' for Muslim fundamentalists the content of the cartoons roils beliefs that they live and die for.  Other European countries expressed solidarity with the Danes', ' reaffirming their rights to freedom of speech.  Likewise', ' Muslim extremists worldwide are rioting and calling it blasphemy.\\t\\tAppiah is', ' of course', ' a product of Western schooling', \" so his position is probably more on the side of the Danes. (I'm assuming since this book was written before the incident.)  Appiah's cosmpolitanism stands for enlightened liberal values\", ' but with a difference.  He recognizes that Muslim fundamentalism is a challenge to cosmopolitanism - he calls them counter-cosmopolitans - because it too is a morality', ' a universal one.  However', \" Muslim fundamentalism is not a tolerant universalism.  Appiah's cosmopolitanism believes in universal truth as well\", ' \\\\\"though we are less certain we already have all of it.\\\\\"  This is not skepticism nor is it relativism', ' it is a more humble relationship with universal truth.  Cosmopolitans believe that there are many values worth living for', ' its just that we cannot live for all of them', ' but we can live alongside them.\\t\\tAnd how will the cartoon drama play itself out?  My guess is that the Muslim fundamentalists will not back down', ' for them it is blasphemy pure and simple.  The Danes', ' being secular', ' tolerant', ' and inclined towards cosmopolitanism', ' will recognize that freedom of speech is an excercise in self-restraint.  They will have learned that the cartoons genuinely offended a certain group of people', ' and', ' as a consequence', ' they will apologize', ' but without abandoning their values. This illustrates another aspect of cosmopolitanism known as fallibilism.  They know that knowledge is at best imperfect and is subject to change in the light of new understanding.  The Danes will have learned something from this incident because cosmopolitanism is a open-ended system', ' the Muslim fundamentalists', ' on the other hand', ' will have learned  nothing beyond what they already know.\\t\\t\\\\\"Cosmopolitans don\\'t insist that everyone become cosmopolitan.  They know they don\\'t have all the answers.  They\\'re humble enough to think that they might learn from strangers; not too humble to think that strangers can\\'t learn from them.\\\\\"\"']\n",
        "['10.2307/41472361', 'Cosmopolitanism', '039332933X', 'In my opinion this book deserves considerably less acclaim than it appears to have received.  As a modest call for understanding among cultural groups, who could disagree?  Appiah, however, himself a product of two contrasting cultures, here takes on a more daunting task: reconciling his respect for the cultures of both his African father and English mother, but the result is a rather incoherent narrative, especially in chapters 2 and 3.  This is perhaps best demonstrated by two statements that appear on p-42.  In defense of his paternal culture, he first writes \\\\There is nothing unreasonable', ' then', ' about my kinsmen\\'s belief in witchcraft.\\\\\"  His word \\\\\"then\\\\\" is a reflection of his claim', ' made on the previous pages', ' that the \\\\\"Duhem thesis\\\\\" allows him to argue that all attempts to grasp reality are culturally conditioned and can therefore be regarded as \\\\\"valid\\\\\" within the cultures in which they arise.  However', ' this claim seriously misconstrues the Duhem thesis', ' with Appiah\\'s arguments reflecting the postmodernist thinking of the \\\\\"science wars\\\\\" era of some 30 years ago that is now largely discredited.  But then comes his second statement as his mother\\'s culture comes to the fore: \\\\\"What\\'s wrong with the theory of witchcraft is not that it doesn\\'t make sense but that it isn\\'t true.\\\\\"  In these two statements one can see the tension in Appiah\\'s struggle to reconcile his bicultural upbringing.  That his Asante father really believes he is communicating with his ancestors when he  pours  whiskey on the floor (p-34) may be interesting', ' but that is hardly a convincing alternative to the scientific worldview of his maternal forebearers.\\t\\tAnother problem is Appiah\\'s seeming unawareness that \\\\\"culture\\\\\" can be a literal prison for a sensitive person raised within it.  In defense of what used to be called \\\\\"female genital mutilation\\\\\" he here (p-73) tells African women that the operation can be regarded as \\\\\"an expression of your cultural identity.\\\\\"  Try telling that to Hirsi Ali', ' whose efforts to free herself', ' at considerable personal risk', ' of the bonds of a very similar cultural background after having received such a \\\\\"cultural identity\\\\\" mark has attracted worldwide attention.  Also unmentioned by him is any recognition that over the span of human history it has often been precisely those who found the courage to think and act in opposition to their cultural heritage who became some of humanities greatest benefactors.  When confronted by epilepsy Jesus saw only a boy possessed by demons', ' but 400 years earlier while discussing that same disease Hippocrates mocked his cultural compatriots and their demon-haunted world by claiming that epilepsy was nothing more than the result of natural causes', \" and he thereby laid the foundations for the long journey that culminated in the benefits of modern medicine.  Appiah's primary motivation seems to be a desire to step on no one's toes\", ' but his efforts are unconvincing', ' and he might well have considered these comments of Edward Grant', ' a major figure in understanding the history of science.  While speaking of the cultural backwardness of medieval Europe when faced by the superior cultures of the Middle East', ' Grant wrote:\\t\\t\\\\\"Latin scholars in the 12th century recognized that not all cultures are equal. They were painfully aware that with respect to science and natural philosophy', ' their civilization was manifestly inferior to that of Islam. They faced an obvious choice: learn from their superiors or remain inferior forever. They chose to learn. Had they assumed that all cultures were equal . . . they would have had no reason to seek out Arab learning and the glorious scientific legacy that followed would not have occurred.\\\\\"\\t\\tWell said', ' even though Appiah provides little evidence of grasping the significance of such a perspective.\"']\n",
        "['10.2307/41472361', 'Cosmopolitanism', '039332933X', 'There are few individuals more qualified to write a book on the idea of cosmopolitanism than Kwame Anthony Appiah.  Biracial, raised in both Ghana and England, multicultural, multilingual, educated at Cambridge but teaching at Princeton, Appiah has an inside familiarity with larger world that few can rival.  It is tremendously encouraging to me, a WASP who has been unable to engage in any real travel, that we both seem to share precisely the same ideals.  My experience of the world counts for little; his a great deal.  Yet it shows that people with extremely different backgrounds can embrace the same ideals.\\t\\tAppiah is a philosopher, but though he has clearly been raised in the Anglo-American linguistic philosophical tradition, he has not found himself restricted by it.  From the various philosophers he quotes, I\\'m sure that he and had had similar philosophical training.  I envy the way that he can make what I learned as logical positivism (Appiah lops off the \\\\logical\\\\\") and make it relevant in a discussion of wider cultural issues.  Though he obviously was trained in the tradition honed by Russell', ' Carnap', ' Frege', ' Ryle', ' Austin', ' Anscombe', ' Dummett', ' and the large contingent of American and British logicians and philosophers of language', ' none of them have informed his literary style.  In fact', ' the two writers Appiah reminds me of most are Herodotus and Montaigne.  Like them', ' he feels a license to bring into his discussion almost anything.  If he is cosmopolitan on a moral and social level', ' he is also as a multidisciplinarian.  Nor does he hesitate at mixing cultures.  Many of the most compelling passages in the book detail incidents from his experience in Ghana.\\t\\tThe point of the book is to discuss many of the problems that arise if one attempts to embrace--as Appiah clearly feels we all should--cosmopolitan ideals.  He deals interestingly with a host of issues', ' from the idea of who owns the products of a culture to the incommensurability of values from one culture to another (or their possible commensurability) to whether it is problematic when there are conflicts on fundamental issues.  As a person he seems to have been deeply molded by all of the cultural influences in which he grew up', ' but as a philosopher he is exceptionally British.  Over the decades there have been a number of British thinkers who have been able to cut through a thick wad of nonsense and discuss issues in a balanced', ' commonsensical manner.  Gilbert Ryle had this capacity', ' as did (sometimes) G. E. Moore', ' and so also Mary Midgley.  While his views are unquestionably progressive', ' Appiah always seems to avoid extremes to arrive at conclusions that are', ' above all else', ' balanced and reasonable.  He is a master at making sense.  So when philosopher Peter Unger argues that we all have a moral obligation to give every penny that we do not need for our own sustenance to organizations like UNICEF and OXFAM so that food and medicine can be purchased for the desperately poor in the Third World.  Appiah', ' on the other hand', ' believes that a world in which no one bought a ticket to the opera would be flat and uninteresting.  Besides', ' what really matters is reforming local governments in order to provide long-term transformation of the socioeconomic structures in the areas most afflicted by poverty', ' something that giving exclusively to UNICEF and OXFAM will not accomplish (though for the record', ' Appiah thinks both organizations are very important and he does not discourage contributing to them).  Though he does not state it as a principle', \" he constantly employs something akin to Aristotle's golden mean.\\t\\tI especially enjoyed his chapter on The Counter-Cosmopolitans.  He places many of today's Islamic extremists in this category\", \" though he also very correctly places many Christian fundamentalists here as well.  I have long fantasized about writing a book about contemporary proponents of Counter-Enlightenment ideas (a book I will never write because I haven't mastered the range of disciplines such a project would require).  Isaiah Berlin wrote frequently about various Counter-Enlightenment thinkers such as Hamaan\", ' but I believe it can be extended into the present for such mass movements as various religious fundamentalisms (Christian', ' Islamic', ' as well as Jewish)', ' the New Age movement', ' contemporary astrology', ' right wing political movements', \" and free market capitalism.  Obviously I can't make my claim here\", \" but I found Appiah's discussion of the counter-cosmopolitans to overlap entirely with counter-enlightenment ideals.\\t\\tI value this book not only for its ideals and the intelligent discussion of a host of thorny issues\", ' but for Appiah\\'s warm humanity and wonderful literary style.  It is not merely an intelligent book but a well-written one as well.\"']\n",

But all humanity is our neighbor, like them or not.\\t\\tMr. Appiah, the renowned Princeton philosophy professor, challenges us with the paradox of a common humanity, among which, different ethnic and religious groups often do not share customs, or even the same values.  The Cosmopolitan thesis is that, despite being strangers in many ways, our common humanity provides a basis for mutual respect and compassion.\\t\\tWhat anchors the paradox at one end is that, for most of human history, we knew only our own kind, with limited need to understand, let alone to accept, the customs of people in other groups.  Over the last few centuries, increased trade and communication, as well as industrial pollution and international terrorism, has changed framework.  Since our actions can affect \\\\lives everywhere', '\\\\\" ethical living implies responsibilities beyond our immediate environment and social group.  Humanity has become', ' in a sense', ' one \\\\\"tribe.\\\\\"\\t\\tMr. Appiah reminds us that the view of being a citizen of the world reflects intellectual traditions at least as old as classical times; that Marcus Aurelius', ' whose works were attractive to many Christian intellectuals', ' himself sought to suppress Christianity; that', ' then again', ' Christianity', ' whose allegiances have often fueled persecution', ' originally spread from Paul\\'s assertion of \\\\\"neither Jew nor Greek . . . . for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\\\\\"  Yet', ' Mr. Appiah also reminds us', ' respect for those different includes respect for their freedom to be separate', ' as in the case of the Amish in the United States.\\t\\tIf you find yourself often straddling the same paradox and long to find a partner in the journey', \" you will find one in Mr. Appiah's short (196 pp.)\", ' varied', ' and challenging book.  He provides examples of agreeing', ' yet agreeing to disagree.  The non-Muslim for example', \" would agree on the devout's right to make a hajj to Mecca\", ' but may not agree that a Deity has commanded it', ' or that avoiding pork is appropriate.  The paradox is exemplified in explanations of the natural world.  Even an agreement on facts leaves ambiguity in theories; e.g.', \" whether it is germs or (many tiny) spirits that cause disease.  Mr. Appiah makes a case that there are even fewer compelling arguments based on fact in the determination of values.  The journey continues to the Ghana of the author's father\", ' where we find out about \\\\\"taboos\\\\\" dealing with bush meat and menstruating women.  A distinction made here is that', ' while taboos separate peoples', ' or classes within peoples (rulers', ' nobles', ' and slaves)', ' morals differ in that they guide us in the treatment of others', ' so a taboo is a distinction with less of a difference.  Even so', ' taboos are common to all cultures; westerners eat pigs but not cats.\\t\\tA cosmopolitan understands and can live with difference', ' even when the differences are mutually understood.  A \\\\\"universalist', '\\\\\" on the other hand', ' expects agreement through understanding.  Mr. Appiah has us step back from taboos', ' to the more engaging questions of values.  Still', ' while most people in a society value fair punishment', ' not all agree that punishment is worth the risk of punishing the innocent; while men in different societies relate their honor to the chastity of related women', ' not all of these men would agree that honor compels killing a woman who is raped.  We find that reasoned argument does not compel either of these positions to those taking them.  There seems to be a sort of getting \\\\\"used to', '\\\\\" that even a great mathematician (von Neumann) would endorse as reason\\'s companion.\\t\\tMr. Appiah\\'s treads lightly across serious subjects', ' and perhaps that is a cosmopolitan virtue.  He contends that strangers are beyond communication mainly when they are imaginary; that is', ' when they are people we have not met one-to-one.  Also', ' that', ' among diversity', ' there are inevitable commonalities:  \\\\\"I have failed to get people interested in Zeno\\'s paradox in three continents.\\\\\"  That', ' when caring about others requires an \\\\\"out-group', '\\\\\" one\\'s caring is perhaps mere self-comfort.\\t\\tMr. Appiah explores the concept of cultural preservation.  He proposes a difference between preserving culture and preserving cultures.  He challenges the idea of \\\\\"authenticity', '\\\\\" as limited by the facts of history', ' such as the role of trade in the development of kente cloth and bagpipes.  The need to \\\\\"preserve\\\\\" is argued as an ignorance of how free non-Westerners are to interpret American TV and consumer products.  At worst', ' an attitude of cultural preservation condescends.  We learn that the ancients saw the value of \\\\\"contamination\\\\\":  stoic teachers traveling between city states', ' an African-born playwright', ' Publius Terentius Afer', ' using Greek ideas in Roman drama.  We are offered', ' quoting this playright', ' a golden rule:  \\\\\"I am human: nothing is alien to me.\\\\\"\\t\\tWe are given a glimpse of the founder of the scouting movement', ' collecting (or looting?)', \" as a prelude to a discussion of cultural objects.  Mr. Appiah takes us to the question of whether a Norse goblet is more valuable in a Spanish museum or in a Norwegian family's living room.  Cosmopolitanism proposes that the connection through ethnic identity across centuries is no less real than the connection through a common humanity.\\t\\tMr. Appiah includes some discussion of counter-cosmopolitans\", ' for example', ' Islamic fundamentalists', ' to help us understand by way of contrast.  The universal aspect in this case', ' and in others', ' is one that looks beyond borders or ethnicity', ' and excludes those who disbelieve.  This discussion evokes the cosmopolitan understanding that different people will have different values', ' and that this is quite acceptable (with some exception for values not worth having).  The cosmopolitan knows that one can learn from those with whom one disagrees.  The counter-cosmopolitan sees nothing to be gained by reaching out from the faithful.\\t\\tFinally', \" we are given the author's reflection on questions of sacrifice for the benefit of others.  So\", ' how much would we sacrifice to save the life of a child in a foreign country with nutrition and medicine?  One hundred dollars?  If that much', ' why not more - say', \" another hundred dollars.  Or is there a point when it's more important to go the opera?  And - is it really possible to save another's life for more than a few days\", ' given the harsh realities of their life situation.  Is it as easy as deciding to ruin a suit in order to save a child from drowning', ' and why?  What is the principle behind the answers to these questions', ' if there is one.\\t\\tThe journey continues:  Mr. Appiah provides an informative and provocative guide to how to treat strangers', ' meant of course', ' in the large.  I do not guarantee the reader will find comfortable answers', ' only insights and surprising information', ' and that your answers', ' which are how you actually live', ' will now have questions to challenge them.\"']\n",
        "['10.2307/41472361', 'Cosmopolitanism', '039332933X', 'Appiah (the Laurence S Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy and the Center for Human Values at Princeton University)writes in an urbane introduction to the issues multiculturalism poses for our society and should be must reading for all those who want to really understand the complexity of our new century. After reading this book we might all be able to agree (to paraphrase what someone famously said about Keynes) that we are all cosmopolitian (ists) now. No one can truly escape into their own monocultural island --our cities, our media and most important our language and culture are infused with layer upon layer of global cultures whether we are aware of them or not. Appiah begins by examining the root meanings of cosmopolitianism--\\t\\t\\\\A citizen--a polites--belonged to a particular polis', ' a city to which he or she owed loyalty. The cosmos referred to the world', ' not in the sense of the earth but in the sense of the universe. Talk of cosmopolitianism originally signaled', ' then a rejection of the conventional view that every civilized person belonged to a community among communities.\\\\\"\\t\\tAppiah\\'s easy non academic style helps you understand the role of the Enlightenment thinkers such as Wieland--(once called the German Voltaire Appiah adds) who wrote\\t\\\\\"Cosmopolitans..regard all the people of the earth as so many branches of a single family', ' and the universe as a state', ' of which they', ' with innumerable other than rational beings', ' are citizens', ' are citizens', ' promoting together under the general laws of nature the perfection of the whole', ' while each in his own fashion is busy about his own well-being.\\\\\"\\t\\tAppiah\\'s learning is worn lightly as he answers the all important question --what does it mean to hold the view that we are citizens of the world? What happens to local allegiances--for Virginia Woolf it meant--\\\\\"freedom from unreal loyalties\\\\\" and Leo Tolstoy wrote about the \\\\\"stupidity of patriotism\\\\\"--on the opposite side of the equation are people like Hitler and Stalin who are deep foes of cosmpolitianism and we all know how that ended up. Appiah\\'s huge store of reading helps him navigate through the issue of loyalties which lies at the heart of the question. George Eliot\\'s creation of Daniel Deronda-the very English gentleman who discovers his Jewish heritage only as an adult--explains his interest in studying his heritage in these terms', ' \\\\\"I want to be an Englishman', ' but I want to understand other points of view. And I want to get rid of the a merely English attitude in studies.\\\\\"\\t\\tThe issue comes down to self definition and how we claim it--we have to be open to the idea that our cultural background creates a way we can connect with others--Eliot talks of the \\\\\"closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical.\\\\\"\\t\\tAnd this is just the introduction! The cluster of questions Appiah considers are truly wide ranging -but often remain invisible in debate--questions such \\\\\"as what we owe strangers by virtue of our shared humanity?', ' can culture be \\\\\"owned\\\\\" ?\\tAs a philosopher he can be skilled with applying some important distinctions--so for example when we talk about objective values we are really talking about desired values --some of which depend on certain facts--he gives the example of universal vaccination as being a value --but we are often prepared to give this value up when the disease has been eliminated. Where we often go astray Appiah argues is where we view an individual\\'s moral vocabulary as belonging to one individual--all the important values-such as kindness', ' cruelty are public and shared across cultures. It is first and foremost evaluative language we are using--a way of communicating to each other our preferences--if your values were not shared in language --there would be no way we could refer to them. The reason why values are important in our society is that they allow us to get things done together--we appeal to those values in order to act in the public forum--whether it is building a road', ' going to the moon', ' or making peace. Our stories that we share embody our values and certain stories are more important than others in our national culture because they enshrine some key values. So one of the purposes of studying a foreign language and reading books in translation is to appreciate the nuances of other people\\'s values.\\t\\tNot all chapters are discursive essays--some are personal meditations based on growing up in Ghana and the ways that the culture and beliefs shape someone so that conversation sometimes becomes problematic. The author gives the example of medicine and how the conversation between someone who believes in witchcraft to accept the findings of modern medicine. Why should they believe in viruses--that you cannot see? Just because you said so? You can say that you can predict who can get well but not who will get sick. In the end you have to appeal to a community of people who can test the evidence that goes beyond the anectdotal and subjective.\\t\\tThere are insights all along the way--for example the independence movements in Africa and elsewhere that brought to an end colonial rule were arguments about values--not African values per se --but values embodied in the rhetoric that had\\tguided the Allies in their conflict with the Axis powers--\\\\\"It was a conflict of interests couched in terms of the same values.\\\\\"\\t\\tImportant points are made about so called cultural purity and cultural contamination--we see so many examples of ethnic communities within hetrogeneous cultures choosing to live within their own cultural borders--but as Appiah so eloquently argues--\\\\\"cultural purity is an oxymoron\\\\\"--multiculturalism is in some shape or form in all our lives--in the Middle East', ' in China', ' in Ghana and in our own western world. The entire history of culture has been related to mixing one cultural strain with another--from the Roman through to the Alexanderian and British empires to the American century--cultures are continually reinterpreted and reinvented. Intolerance for others is bred of universalistic fundamentalist creeds whether they be Islamic or Christian or Jewish can as we know all too well lead to dangerous consequences--however as Appiah reminds us the truly toxic aspects of this are not so much in terms of those beliefs but their fear and sometimes prohibition of conversation. Without conversation they can extend their belief that \\\\\"not everyone matters\\\\\" and other equally savage ideas and not owe anyone a justification as to why. They don\\'t want to be drawn into explaining precisely because they don\\'t want to have to justify themselves or their beliefs to others--because they know that their values are not ultimately defensible. Reason is at the center of it all--\\\\\"come let us reason together\\\\\" should be the motto of every civilized person--it offers a ground for your thinking and my thinking.\\t\\tIn terms of the central question--what are our obligations to others--Appiah\\'s answer is to be common sensical--it is to do \\\\\"our fair share\\\\\"--we cannot be required to do more. But what is our \\\\\"fair share\\\\\"? How do we deal with the fact that so many people are not doing their fair share? He discusses this and other issues--such as the paradox that one of the world\\'s greatest capitalists is providing billions to help eradicate preventable diseases around the globe and our economic system allows the average cow to live on a $2.50 a day subsidy when 3 billion people live on less than $2 dollars a day. Appiah points out that Jeffrey Sachs has argued that we can eradicate extreme poverty for about $150 billion a year for 20 years. Clearly we can do better', ' as Appiah argues it is a \\\\\"demand of simple morality\\\\\" and we can also agree with him that this end might be more achievable \\\\\"if we made civilization more cosmopolitan\\\\\"\"']\n",

However, all understood and/or demonstrated the meaning of &quot;true friendship.&quot; For example, the stories included everything from the thankful musings of a once-ill woman about the extraordinaty kindness of her girlfriends to a giggly account of how two eerily-simiar best friends met as assigned roomates their first day of college. (The latter tale struck very close to home in a wonderfully spooky way.)<p>While many of the stories tugged at the heartstrings, I never felt manipulated by the authors. (Note: Part of the reason why I don't like the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; series is that I feel that the authors are just dying to make the reader clutch for the box of tissues.)  Rather, I appreciated the &quot;real&quot; tone of the stories, as they read like good conversation shared over a nice pot of Hazlenut coffee.<p>Some readers have commented on the book's simple language and lack of depth. I don't think the goal here was to explore the psychology of friendship, rather I think it was intended to be a simple and beautiful celebration meant to be enjoyed by &quot;Girlfriends&quot; everywhere.

Feel frustrated and angry at the people around you who, no matter how much you plead, won't change and start behaving the way you want?  Here's a solution.  <p>Dr. Harriet Lerner's &quot;The Dance of Anger&quot; provides a whole new approach for women who feel stuck and powerless.  Using case studies, Lerner demonstrates ways that women can change their reactions when other people's behavior and expectations upsets them.  Her basic premise:  You can't change how others treat you--you can only change how you respond.  Throughout the book, Lerner provides examples of how women can set boundaries with friends, family members and others so that they can break out of unsatisfying relationship patterns.<p>The &quot;Thinking in Threes&quot; chapter addresses ways that third parties get pulled into conflicts, and how to better handle these situations by focusing on the source of the conflict.<p>Lerner's book is an excellent source for learning a &quot;new dance&quot;--a new way of approaching life.  One caveat:  I question whether this approach would be safe or appropriate for someone dealing with domestic violence or an emotionally abusive relationship.  While several experts in that area have said that the reason people abuse is because it works, making the abuse no longer work by using Lerner's approach of changing one's reaction to that behavior could make the abuse escalate.  From the training I've received in domestic violence (I'm not a therapist but I do have some professional training in this area), I believe that the most dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship occurs when she tries to get out of that relationship.  Changing one's response to abusive behavior under Lerner's recommendations might make the situation more dangerous.\", 'doi': '10.2307/25762901', 'amazon_id': '006074104X', 'title': 'Changing Relationships'}\n",

For me, it was &#34;The Dance of Anger&#34; by Harriet Lerner.\\t\\tThis book was a person choice to read after finding myself often feeling frustrated and irate about things that shouldn't make me feel that way. Sometimes we can write it off as a bad day, PMS, bad night's sleep, lack of coffee, or running into grumpy people all day.  Whatever the cause, it was tiresome feeling cranky. I've read other books on anger, even done workbooks, but nothing really affected me the way this book did. I can say that she laid it all out in simple terms, but she didn't. Ms. Lerner didn't take the &#34;dumb it down&#34; route that some authors do because they feel the readers won't understand all the psychological mumbo-jumbo.\\t\\tFrom the first page of this book to the last, I had so many &#34;ah-ha&#34; and &#34;oh my Lord&#34; and &#34;that's me!&#34; moments that with the highlighting and post-it flags the book now resembles a neon pinata. This book has a permanent spot on my headboard for whenever I find myself having a bad day, which I have to admit is now a rare occurrence. For the first time, after reading so many other books on anger, I finally truly understand the dance, the circle dance that we do to perpetuate the circular dance of anger.  And it comes down to having the courage to step up within yourself and be the one to walk away from the dance.  It's the hardest yet easiest thing I have ever done. It's been several weeks since I finish this book for the first time, and the change in my behavior is noticeable to everyone I know. And my behavior helps influence their behavior, which helps them step away from the dance of anger. Several friends and family members have purchased and read this book, and we all agree that it's a must read.\\t\\tBy reading this book, or even taking the step to buy it, it doesn't mean that you have anger issues. Every one of us is entitled to feel grumpy and cranky and irate just as we are entitled to feel happy and less stressed and calm. Ms.Learner explains how life's little annoyances can creep into our lives and add to whatever stress we already have. Her goal is to help keep those little annoyances and stressors out of our lives, to stop the stupid arguments over who forgot to pick up the mail.\\t\\tIf you have ever wanted to stop letting the small matters snowball into big problems, please read this book. It really will make a difference.\", 'doi': '10.2307/25762901', 'amazon_id': '006074104X', 'title': 'Changing Relationships'}\n",

However, I found it very frustrating to read all of the links between anger patterns and gender. While I believe there is probably some correlation between gender and anger (i.e. women are often taught to de-self in order to go along with others and prevent conflict, men might be more likely to be taught to distance from feelings), I think it is a loose correlation (I know many logical and calm females and many feeling sensitive males, and vice versa, and everything in between).  I don't see how labeling some anger patterns as typically male or female is supposed to help clarify anger patterns in oneself.  In fact, I find it counterproductive and distracting from the real matter.  Isn't the point to find out what anger patterns you might be exhibiting in your own life and create positive ones?  Why not leave the gender stuff out of it and discuss different healthy and unhealthy anger patterns for people to identify with or not?  Why sidetrack and convolute the issue by saying females will typically act this way, and males will typically act this way, when the author even says this isn't always true? Unless you believe your gender directly causes your anger pattern 100% of the time, I just don't see the point.\", 'doi': '10.2307/25762901', 'amazon_id': '006074104X', 'title': 'Changing Relationships'}\n",

ALL anger-advice books overlook insufficient adrenals', \" yet one of the MAJOR symptoms is constant irritation.

I had to arrange and pay for my own lab tests (the so-called \\\\\"gold standard\\\\\" tests are wrong!) and then (because most doctors', ' including endos', ' really do not understand) find a truly knowledgeable physician through patient recommendations on the \\\\\"Stop the Thyroid Madness\\\\\" website.\\t\\tAfter a few months of PROPER treatment my anger/irritability simply melted away! (slowly)\\t\\tThe more stress you have had in your lifetime', ' the more likely you are to have adrenal issues (I had a high-powered job for 20 years but then had to limp through the last ten years before I was able to retire by going part-time - which of course meant low quality work at much lower pay). So', ' here are some FREE home/self tests for identifying struggling adrenals:\\t\\tTEST ONE:\\tTake and compare two blood pressure readings--one while lying down and one while standing. Rest for five minutes while sitting before taking the first reading. Stand up and immediately take the blood pressure again. If either blood pressure reading is lower after standing', ' suspect adrenal gland problems', ' and more specifically', ' an aldosterone issue-another adrenal hormone. The degree to which the blood pressure drops while standing is often proportionate to the degree of hypoadrenalism. (Normal adrenal function will raise your BP on the standing reading in order to push blood to the brain.) It can be wise to do this test both in the morning and in the evening', ' since you can appear normal one time', ' and not another. (BP monitors are available cheaply on Amazon)\\t\\tTEST TWO:\\tLet someone shine a bright light your way. Do you find yourself very sensitive and uncomfortable with the bright light (similarly with bright summer sunshine)? That could be a sign of adrenal fatigue. And this can also be true if you have searing headaches along with the sensitivity.\\t\\tTEST THREE:\\tThis is called the Pupil test and primarily tests your levels of aldosterone', ' another adrenal hormone. You need to be in a darkened room with a mirror and a flashlight/ torch/ penlight. Do this later in the day as results are more reliable then. From the side (not the front)', ' shine a bright light towards your pupils and hold it for about a minute. Carefully observe the pupil. With healthy adrenals (and specifically', ' healthy levels of aldosterone)', ' your pupils will constrict', ' and will stay small the entire time you shine the light from the side. In adrenal fatigue', ' the pupil will get small', ' but within 30 seconds', ' it will soon enlarge again or obviously flutter in its attempt to stay constricted.\\t\\tWhy? Because adrenal insufficiency can also result in low aldosterone', ' which causes a lack of proper amounts of sodium and an abundance of potassium. This imbalance causes the sphincter muscles of your eye to be weak and to dilate in response to light. (Note: there are over 50 sphincters in the body and stress incontinence caused by adrenal fatigue is difficult to fix just with pelvic floor exercises.)\\t\\tTEST FOUR:\\tTake your temp 3 times a day', ' starting three hours after you wake up', ' and every three hours after that', \" to equal three temps. (If you have eaten or exercised right before it's time to take your temp\", ' wait 20 more minutes.) Then average them for that day. Do this for AT LEAST 5 days. If your averaged temp is fluctuating from day to day more than .2 to .3 (with a lean towards .2)', ' you need adrenal support. Again', ' your daily average temps should lean towards the .2 when on enough cortisol for your needs.\\t\\tIf your temps are fluctuating but overall low', ' you need both adrenal and thyroid support. If your temps are fluctuating but averaging 98.6', ' you just need adrenal support. If it is steady but low', ' you need thyroid support and adrenals are likely fine.\\t(mercury thermometers are the most accurate but very difficult to buy nowadays', ' next best are liquid thermometers', ' then digital thermometers - which can be wrong by up to 1degreeF. Do NOT use ear thermometers.)\\t\\tTEST FIVE:\\tThis is the easiest home test for adrenal deficiency', ' from Wilson\\'s excellent 2001 book (still a classic) called \\\\\"Adrenal Fatigue\\\\\": all you need for this test is a ball point pen. Drag the dull end of a pen across your abdomen for about six inches (my guess would be about 2 fingers\\' width above or below your belly button) but don\\'t press overly hard or scratch the skin. If your adrenals are functioning normally or are only mildly affected', ' the mark will turn from white to red within about 10 seconds. If your adrenals are fatigued', ' however', \" the line will widen and stay white for about 2 minutes. This test isn't terribly accurate as it only shows up on about 40 per cent of people with low adrenal function. It generally tests positive only if the adrenal fatigue is fairly severe.\\t\\tThe outer cortex of our adrenal glands produces the hormones cortisol\", ' aldosterone', ' testosterone', ' DHEA', ' DHEAS', ' androstenedione and estrogens. Dysfunctional adrenals equates first to combined highs and lows of cortisol that are not normal', ' then to low cortisol (and sometimes low aldosterone as well as imbalances in other hormones). The Stop the Thyroid Madness website has much free practical information on adrenal issues as well as low thyroid.

Luckily, I did not pay for any of these books, so I can just be glad I read this one, and forget about the others.<p>In this book, Lerner treats anger as a signal that something is going wrong. She explains that only when we address the &quot;something wrong&quot; in a useful way will the anger go away. Then she explores the &quot;dances&quot; we engage in, in our attempts to make ourselves feel better. She suggests that most of our attempts to make ourselves feel better focus on the person(s) we think made us mad, rather than on ourselves. She compassionately and wisely shows how to disengage from the anger and the counter-productive patterns, while staying connected and acting with integrity. However, she also acknowledges the effect that this sort of change can have on other people in the dance, and she provides guidance in maintaining oneself in the face of countermoves. <p>Fundamentally, this is not the kind of self-help book that provides 10 easy steps to ridding oneself of anger.

        "{'review_text': \"The Dance of Anger by Dr. Harriet Lerner, Kindle Version\\tA BOOK REPORT BY REV. DR. JUDE ARNOLD\\tI was happy to find the eBook version of Dr. Lerner's 1970's classic.  I'm finding writing my first review of an eBook much more challenging, tho.  Dr. Lerner, a champion in women's psychology, offers us this awesome self help around anger.  I begin with the Epilogue in which Dr. Lerner talks about what she means by self help.\\t\\\\'Defining a self' or `becoming  one's  own person' is a task that one ultimately does alone....In the end\", None: [' I define what I think', ' feel and believe....Yet', ' this lonely and challenging task cannot be accomplished in isolation.  We can only accomplish it through our connectedness with others and the new learning about ourselves our relationships provide.\\\\\"(Italics and Underlining throughout are Dr. Lerner\\'s.)\\tIn her books Dr. Learner always stresses \\\\\"the importance of learning about the experience of family members and sharing our own.\\\\\"  She also adds her belief that it\\'s \\\\\"equally crucial for us to connect with the family of womankind....This book [is] about personal anger and personal change', ' but as feminism has taught us', \" `the personal is political.' This means that there is a circular connection between the patterns of our intimate relationships and the degree to which women are represented\", ' valued', ' and empowered in every aspect of society and culture....  \\\\\"It is not sufficient for individual women to learn to move differently in personal relationships.  If we do not also challenge and change the societal institutions that keep women in a subordinate and de-selfed position outside the home', ' what goes on inside the home will continue to be problematic for us all....Whether the problem we face is a marital battle or the escalating nuclear arms race', ' women and men both have a long legacy of blaming people rather than understanding patterns.  Our challenge is to listen carefully to our own anger and use it in the service of change - while we hold tight to all that is valuable in our female heritage and tradition.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner wrote The Dance of Anger \\\\\"to help readers not only identify the true sources of their anger', ' but also to learn how to change the patterns from which anger springs....The challenge of anger is at the heart of our struggle to achieve intimacy', ' self-esteem', ' and joy.  Learning how to deal with it is worth the journey', ' even though there are no six-easy-steps to personal fulfillment and relationship bliss.  The Dance of Anger teaches readers to understand how relationships operate and how to change our part in them.  It encourages readers to go the hard route.\\\\\"\\tAnger is a signal that \\\\\"can motivate us to say `no\\' to the ways in which we are defined by others and `yes\\' to the dictates of our inner self.  Women', ' however', ' have long been discouraged {and condemned} for the awareness and forthright expression of anger....The taboos against our feeling and expressing anger are so powerful that even knowing when we are angry is not a simple matter.  When a woman shows her anger', ' she is likely to be dismissed as irrational or worse....  \\\\\"Why are angry women so threatening to others?  If we are guilty', ' depressed', ' or self-doubting we stay in place.  We do not take action except against our own selves and we are unlikely to be agents of personal and social change.  In contrast', ' angry women may change and challenge the lives of us all', ' as witnessed by the past decade of feminism.\\\\\"  (I believe she refers', ' unfortunately', ' to the 1960\\'s here.)\\t\\\\\"Anger is something we feel.  It exists for a reason and always deserves our respect and attention.  We all have a right to everything we feel - and certainly our anger is no exception....Our anger signals a problem', ' but provides us with no answers - not even a clue - as to how to solve it.\\\\\"  Dr. Lerner does not however advocate venting anger or letting it all hang out.  \\\\\"Feelings of depression', ' low self-esteem', ' self-betrayal', ' and even self-hatred are inevitable when we fight but continue to submit to unfair circumstances', ' when we complain but live in a way that betrays our hopes', ' values and potentials....Those of us who are locked into ineffective expressions of anger suffer as deeply as those of us who dare not get angry at all.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner defines two styles of managing anger', ' the nice lady who avoids anger and conflict at all cost', ' and the bitch who is easily angered and fights with no constructive resolution.  In reality', ' both these styles \\\\\"serve equally well to protect others', ' to blur our clarity of self', \" and to ensure that change does not occur....Anger is inevitable when [nice ladies'] lives consist of giving in and going along; when we assume responsibility for other people's feelings and reactions; when we relinquish our primary responsibility to proceed with our own growth and ensure the quality of our own lives; when we behave as if having a relationship is more important than having a self....Nothing\", ' but nothing', ' will block the awareness of anger so effectively as guilt and self-doubt.  Our society cultivates guilt feelings in women such that many of us still feel guilty if we are anything less than an emotional service station to others.\\\\\"  On the other hand', ' the nature of the hysterical bitch\\'s \\\\\"fighting or angry accusations may actually allow the other person to get off the hook\\\\\" protecting old familiar patterns as surely as does silence.  The end result in both these styles is we end up feeling powerless.  Our self-esteem suffers because we have not addressed the real issues causing our anger.\\tIt is in our first family relationships that closeness often leads to stuckness.  Dr. Lerner teaches us to use our anger energy to get unstuck in our stickiest relationships first', ' so these same issues will not fuel the fires in all of our other relationships.  \\\\\"The ability to use anger as a tool for change requires that we gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of how relationships operate....unresolved issues from our past inevitably surface in our current relationships.\\\\\"  We simply must learn to use our anger to change our own patterns of relating rather than blame and try to change other people.\\tDr. Lerner identifies these four areas we need to learn to develop our skills and to use our anger as a tool for change in relationships:  \\\\\"1. We Can Learn to Tune In to the True Sources of Our Anger and Clarify Where We Stand.  \\\\\"2. We Can Learn Communications Skills.  \\\\\"3. We Can Learn to Observe and Interrupt Nonproductive Patterns of Interaction....We cannot make another person change his or her steps to an old dance', ' but if we change our own steps', ' the dance no longer can continue in the same predictable pattern.  \\\\\"4. We Can Learn to Anticipate and Deal with Countermoves and `Change Back!\\' Reactions from Others....In all families there is a powerful opposition to one member defining a more independent self...The powerful emotional counterforce (`You\\'re wrong\\'; `Change back!\\' `Or else....\\') is predictable', ' understandable', ' and to some extent', ' universal.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner adds', ' \\\\\"It is never easy to move away from silent submission or ineffective fighting toward a calm but firm assertion of who we are', ' where we stand', ' what we want', \" and what is and is not acceptable to us....Not only can we acquire new ways of managing old angers; we can also gain a clearer and stronger `I' and with it\", \" the capacity for a more intimate and gratifying `we.'  Many of our problems with anger occur when we choose between having a relationship and having a self.  This book is about having both.....If two people become one\", \" a separation can feel like a psychological or a physical death.  We may have nothing - not even a self to fall back on - when an important relationships ends.  We all need to have both an `I' and a `we' that nourish and give meaning to each other....The more we carve out a clear and separate `I'\", ' the more we can experience and enjoy both intimacy and aloneness.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner demonstrates that  all', ' and especially romantic', ' relationships can be like a seesaw; \\\\\"the underfunctioning of one individual allows for the overfunctioning of the other....The more the man [i.e.] avoids sharing his own weaknesses', ' neediness', ' and vulnerability', ' the more his woman may experience and express more than her share.  The more the woman avoids showing her competence and strength', ' the more her man will have an inflated sense of his own. And if the underfunctioning partner starts looking better', ' the overfunctioning partner will start looking worse....If the woman is further convinced that she herself cannot survive without the relationship', ' she will vent her anger in a manner that only reinforces the old familiar patterns from which her anger stems....  \\\\\"Whenever one person makes a move to rebalance the seesaw', \" there is a countermove by the other party.  There are few things more anxiety-arousing than shifting to a higher level of self-assertion and separateness in an important relationship and maintaining the position despite the countermoves of the other person....Countermoves are the other person's unconscious attempt to restore a relationship to its previous balance or equilibrium\", ' when anxiety about separateness and change gets too high....What matters is the degree to which we are able to take a clear position in a relationship and behave in ways that are congruent with our stated beliefs....The woman who sits at the bottom of a seesaw marriage accumulates a great amount of rage', ' which is in direct proportion to the degree of her submission and sacrifice....Sometimes', ' to develop a stronger `I\\' is to come to terms with our deep-seated wish to leave an unsatisfactory marriage and this possibility may be no less frightening than the fear of being left.\\\\\"\\tDr. Learners covers the subject of triangles in great depth. \\\\\"Identifying the real issues is not an easy matter.  It is particularly difficult among family members because when two adults have a conflict', ' they often bring in a third party to form a triangle', ' which then makes it even harder for the two people involved to identify and work out their problems.... Underground issues from one relationship or context invariably fuel our fires in another.\\\\\" We detour \\\\\"feelings of anger from one person to another....We reduce anxiety in one relationship by focusing on a third party', ' who we unconsciously pull into the situation to lower the emotional intensity in the original pair. Triangles can become rigidly entrenched blocking the growth of the individuals in them and keeping us from identifying the actual sources of conflict in our relationships....Triangles greatly increase the probability of escalating aggression....The three essential ingredients of extricating oneself from a triangle are: staying calm', ' staying out', ' and hanging in.\\\\\"  It is never helpful to anyone to gossip or talk about a third party. \\\\\"In the best of all possible worlds we might envision separate person-to-person relationships with our friends', ' coworkers', ' and family members that were not excessively influenced by other relationships.\\\\\"\\tMost of us put our anger energy into trying to change the other person.  This', ' Dr. Lerner repeatedly exclaims', ' is impossible.  We \\\\\"secretly believe that we have the corner on the `truth\\' and that this would be a much better world if everyone else believed and reacted exactly as we do.  But one of the hallmarks of emotional maturity is to recognize the validity of multiple realities and to understand that people think', ' feel', ' and react differently.\\\\\"  Closeness does not mean sameness.  \\\\\"We have a right to everything we think and feel - and so does everyone else.  It is our job to state our thoughts and feelings clearly and to make responsible decisions that are congruent with our values and beliefs.  It is not our job to make another person think and feel the way we do or the way we want them to.... We are able to move away from ineffective fighting only when we give up the fantasy that we can change or control another person. It is only then that we can reclaim the power that is truly ours - the power to change our own selves and take new and different actions on our own behalf.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner gives example after example illustrating these same basic lessons:  \\\\\"First', \" `letting it all hang out' may not be helpful because venting anger may protect rather than challenge the old rules and patterns in a relationship.  Second\", ' the only person we can change and control is our own self.  Third', ' changing our own self can feel so threatening and difficult that it is often easier to continue an old pattern of silent withdrawal or ineffective fighting and blaming.  And', ' finally', ' de-selfing is at the heart of our most serious anger problems.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Even rats in a maze learn to vary their behavior if they keep hitting a dead end.  Why in the world', ' then', ' do we behave less intelligently than laboratory animals?  Repeating the same old fights protects us from the anxieties we are bound to experience when we make a change....Human nature is such that when we are angry', ' we tend to become so emotionally reactive to what the other person is doing to us that we lose our ability to observe our own part in the interaction....Self-observation is the process of seeing the interaction of ourselves and others', ' and recognizing that the ways other people behave with us has something to do with the way we behave with them.\\\\\"  The form of this circular dance is universal in which the behavior of each serves \\\\\"to maintain and provoke the other.  Once a part of an established twosome - married or unmarried', ' lesbian or straight - the more each person tries to change things', ' the more things stay the same.\\\\\"\\tI am beginning to understand how my interaction had become a circular dance in which my behavior maintained and provoked behavior in my significant other.  \\\\\"In the final analysis it matters little who started it.... A good way to make this break is to recognize the part we play in maintaining and provoking the other person\\'s behavior.  Even if we are convinced that the other person is ninety-seven percent to blame we are still in control of changing our three percent.\\\\\"  Bottom line - \\\\\"We do not have the power to change another person who does not want to change', ' and our attempts to do so may actually protect him or her from change.  This is the paradox of the circular dances in which we all participate.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Opposites do attract', ' but they do not always live happily ever after.  On the one hand', \" it is reassuring to live with someone who will express parts of one's own self that one is afraid to acknowledge; yet\", \" the arrangement has its inevitable costs:  The woman [i.e.]who is expressing feelings not only for herself but also for her husband will indeed end up behaving `hysterically' and `irrationally.'  The man who relies on his wife to do the `feeling work' for him will increasingly lose touch with this important part of himself\", ' \\\\\"and when the time comes that he needs to draw upon his emotional resources', \" he may find that nobody's at home....This is the `masculinity' that our society breeds - the male who feels at home in the world of things and abstract ideas but who has little empathic connection to others \", ' little attunement to his own internal world', \" and little willingness or capacity to `hang in' when a relationship becomes conflicted and stressful... . Doing the `feeling work' like cleaning up has long been defined as `woman's work'\", ' and lots of women are good at it.  As with cleaning up', ' men will not begin to do their shares until women no longer do it for them.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"When a woman vents her anger ineffectively or expresses it in an overemotional style', ' she does not threaten her man.  If anything she helps him maintain his masculine cool', ' while she herself is perceived as infantile or irrational.  When a woman clarifies the issue and uses her anger to move toward something new and different', ' the change occurs.  If she stops over-functioning [overinvolvement] for others and starts acting for herself', ' her underfunctioning [underinvolvement] man is likely to acknowledge and deal with his own anxieties.\\\\\"\\tDr. Lerner goes on to identify two other types of dancers:  \\\\\"Emotional pursuers are persons who reduce their anxiety by sharing feelings and seeking close emotional contact.  Emotional distancers are persons who reduce their anxiety by intellectualizing and withdrawing.\\\\\"  No matter the problem', ' these two styles of responding to stress eventually become at odds. The common outcome of this classic scenario is that \\\\\"after the escalating dance of pursuit and withdrawal proceeds for some time', \" the woman [most often the pursuer] goes into what therapists call `reactive distance'\", \" which only temporarily reverses the pursuit cycle or has little effect at all....When a pursuer stops pursuing and begins to put her energy back into her own life - without distancing or expressing anger at the other person - the circular dance has been broken....A relationship becomes more `true' and balanced as the pursuer can allow herself to acknowledge and express more of her own wish for independence and space\", ' and in turn', ' the distancer can begin to acknowledge more of his dependency and wish for closeness.\\\\\"\\tShe repeats again', ' \\\\\"Changing another person is a solution that never', ' ever works.\\\\\"  The power that is ours is only and always the power to change our own self.  The only real power we have is the power to act and make choices.  However', ' to try to change the other person is usually the first thing we do with our anger.  The second thing we do is cut ourselves off either emotionally or geographically.  Such distancing does bring short-term relief but there are long term costs - \\\\\"the unresolved emotional intensity is likely to get played out in other important relationships....When emotional intensity is high in a family', ' most of us put the entire responsibility for poor communication on the other person....Always', ' we perceive that it is the other who prevents us from speaking and keeps the relationship from changing.  We disown our own part in the interactions we complain of and', ' with it', ' our power to bring about a change.\\\\\"\\tOK! What do we do instead of trying to change the other person or their thoughts and feelings?  We clearly state our beliefs and convictions and we stand behind them. This includes identifying within ourselves the true source of our anger', ' usually our independence from that person.  As we become less scared and guilty about showing our own strong and separate selves', ' in a mature and responsible fashion', ' we become more ready to make a change in the relationship', ' a change to being a separate and different person with our own unique way of being in the world.  With this change comes the experience of separation anxiety', ' most often \\\\\"based on an underlying discomfort with separateness and individuality that has its roots in our early family experience', ' where the unspoken expectation may have been that we keep a lid on our expressions of self.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Hit and Run confrontation does not lead to lasting change.... If serious about change', ' she must show for her own sake as well as the other that at last she is declaring her separateness and independence', ' but she is not declaring a lack of caring or closeness.  Independence means that we clearly define our own selves on emotionally important issues', ' but it does not mean emotional distance....The work of negotiating greater independence may be so fraught with mutual anxieties about rejection and loss that the person making the move must be responsible for maintaining emotional contact with the other.\\\\\"  Success will rest on her ability to share something about herself in a straightforward', ' nonblaming way while maintaining emotional contact throughout the process.  It requires also that she \\\\\"uphold her position with persistence and calm', \" without getting emotionally buffeted about by the inevitable countermoves and `change back!' reactions we meet whenever we assume a more autonomous position in an important relationship. This is what achieving selfhood and independence is all about. And it requires\", ' among other things a particular way of talking and a degree of clarity that are especially difficult to achieve when we are angry.\\\\\"\\tAnother important technique that Dr. Lerner teaches is to turn anger into an \\\\\"I message', '\\\\\" a nonblaming statement about one\\'s own self. She emphasizes that \\\\\"if our goal is to break a pattern in an important relationship and/or to develop a strong sense of self that we can bring to all our relationships', ' it is essential that we learn to translate our anger into clear', \" nonblaming statements about our own self .... The significant issue for women is that we may not have a clear `I' to communicate about and we are not prepared to handle the intense negative reactions that come our way when we do begin  to define and assert the self....Women often fear that having a clear `I' means threatening a relationship or losing an important person.  Thus\", \" rather than using our anger as a challenge to think more clearly about the `I' in our relationships we may\", ' when angry', ' actually blur what personal clarity we do have.\\\\\"\\tWe really fear rocking the boat.  \\\\\"Feeling fuzzy-headed', ' inarticulate', ' and not so smart are common reactions experienced by women as we struggle to take a stand on our own behalf.  It is not just anger and fighting that we learn to fear; we avoid asking precise questions and making clear statements when we unconsciously suspect that doing so would expose our differences', ' make the other person feel uncomfortable', ' and leave us standing alone.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Why would any of us attempt to deny our anger and sacrifice one of our most precious possessions - our personal clarity?\\\\\"  For one thing', ' \\\\\"our very definitions of `masculinity\\' and `femininity\\' are based on the notion that women must function as nonthreatening helpmates and ego builders to men lest men feel castrated and weakened.\\\\\"  This explains when a woman\\'s anger turns to tears; she\\'s attempting to restore togetherness.  Instead she probably needs to work harder at the task of clarifying her separateness and independence within her first family. She cannot control the other person\\'s reaction.  She should not allow herself to be controlled by them either.  \\\\\"She can simply stay on course by listening to what they have to say and then restating her initial position. There is nothing wrong with \\\\\"sounding like a broken record now and then.... She cannot change the other person\\'s mind or ensure that justice will prevail.  She can state her position', ' recognize her choices', ' and make responsible decisions on her own behalf.\\\\\"\\t\\\\\"Our problem is not the fear of clarity but the absence of it.  That we are angry is obvious.  But we may have little perspective on the `I', \"' as a result of focusing exclusively on what the other person is doing to us.... Using our anger as a starting point to become more knowledgeable about the self does not require that we analyze ourselves and provide lengthy psychologically explanations of our reactions....Anger is a tool for change when it challenges us to become more of an expert on the self and less of an expert on others.  Learning to use our anger effectively requires some letting go - letting go of blaming that other person whom we see as causing our problems and failing to provide for our happiness; letting go of the notion that it is our job to change other people or tell them how they should think\", ' feel', ' behave. Yet', ' this does not mean that we passively accept or go along with any behavior.  In fact', \" a `live-and-let-live' attitude can signal a de-selfed position\", ' if we fail to clarify what is and is not acceptable or desirable to us in a relationship.  The main issue is how we clarify our position....We can simply say', ' `well', ' it may seem crazy or irrational to you', \" but this is the way I see it.'  Of course\", ' there is never a guarantee that other people will alter their behavior\\\\\" to suit you and me.\\tDr. Lerner also counsels to not be in a hurry with this.  It\\'s ok to be uncertain.  Sit with it for a while!  She says', ' \\\\\"Slow Down!  Our anger can be a powerful vehicle for personal growth and change if it does nothing more than help us recognize that we are not yet clear about something.\\\\\"  What most of us do when we are angry is judge', ' blame', ' criticize', ' moralize', ' preach', ' instruct', ' interpret', ' and psychoanalyze. She goes on to say', ' \\\\\"If I persist in repeating this point', ' it is because it is an extremely difficult concept to grasp', ' and hold on to when we are angry.  Conflicting wants and different perceptions of the world do not mean that one party is `right\\' and the other `wrong.\\'\\\\\"\\tSome common communication mistakes we make are', ' for starters \\\\\"not being particularly tactful and strategic.  Few people are able to listen well when they are being criticized or told what\\'s wrong with them.\\\\\"  Second', ' we communicate as if to convey that we are an expert on the other person\\'s experience.  \\\\\"\\'Who has the problem?\\' is a question that has nothing to do with guilt or culpability.  The one who has the problem is simply the party who is dissatisfied with or troubled by the particular situation....How many of us can distinguish with confidence where our responsibilities to others begin and end? How can women trained from birth to define ourselves through our loving care of others - know with confidence when it is time to finally say `Enough!\\'?\\\\\" Many woman devote themselves so exclusively to the needs of others that they betray if not lose themselves.\\t\\\\\"If however', \" we do not use our anger to define ourselves clearly in every important relationship we are in - and manage our feelings as they arise - no one else will assume this responsibility for us.  We are never the first in our family to wrestle with a problem although it may feel that way.

It's a radical work, in the sense that Marcuse goes back to the  roots and undertakes the task of carrying Freudian theory to its  inescapable implications. (A task, by the way, set down by Herr Doktor  Professor himself; if your edition of the Britannica still has the text  originally written by Freud in 1926 for the &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;  entry, check out his statement that &quot;the future will probably  attribute far greater importance to psychoanalysis as the science of the  unconscious than as a therapeutic procedure&quot;.) As all true  masterpieces, &quot;Eros&quot; is not flawless: in the latter part of the  book, Marcuse falls into the trap of trying to describe / prescribe how a  society freed from repression would organize itself for the common good,  rather than self-destructing - and, of course, fumbles royally (a failure  he admitted to in his later works). No matter; unless you've read it,  you're like Dylan's Mr. Jones, and will have no inkling on how (and, most  importantly, why) capitalism reinvented itself from industrial back into  financial, much less on what the current &quot;global crisis&quot; is all  about.

Although he primarily deals with Freud and the issue of society\\'s use of repression (psychological and political) in the service of production, he deals with Marxist theory also when you read between the lines. The theme of alienation of labor is clearly one of the resounding and recurring notes in the symphony.\\tAs a psychotherapist intimately acquainted with developments in psychoanalytic theory in the fifty odd years since Marcuse wrote, this project involves some perils as well as some rich veins of thought. To philosophize on the basis of a theory which is derived primarily from clinical work in which two individuals share in a closed setting is always dangerous. In addition, to take Freud\\'s formulations for granted, and then proceed to apply them to social and political systems is a big stretch. I would say primarily that the main flaw in Marcuse\\'s thesis is his acceptance of Thanatos, or the so-called death principle, which is no longer accepted by any school of psychoanalysis. Unfortunately, Freud\\'s own tendency to speculate both in the fields of anthropology and metaphysics, does not help Marcuse any. If one studies Talcott Parsons and his brilliant work on social systems (The Social System) using social theory, one can see a great deal of resonance with Marcuse\\'s analysis of repression as a cultural control mechanism.\\tTo balance the equation, I believe Marcuse brings to surface themes which have been abandoned in modern social discourse through sheer inertia and the grinding power of the repressive culture.

        "{'review_text': \"Brief this is not, but compared to some dry academic tomes it seems brief.  University of Southern California professor Dr. Michael T. Kennedy has the all too rare gift of writing well which he combines with a passion for detail so that this history is packed with the bizarre, the fascinating, the arcane, and the all too often revolting facts of medical delusion, malpractice, and triumph that have characterized the long and tortured history of the healing arts.<p>Note well that this is a history not only of medicine and disease, but of science as well.  The emphasis is on twentieth century developments, which is as it should be since so much has happened in recent times.  This is not to say that the more distant past is neglected.  Kennedy starts with the pre-history and follows the quest for health through Greek and Roman times to &quot;The Rise of Islam and Arabic Medicine&quot; (Chapter 5) with excursions into ayurvedic medicine (from India) and the traditional Chinese practices from antiquity.  He even looks at European health, or the lack thereof, during the Dark and Middle Ages before the rise of science.  When he gets to the modern or nearly modern era, Kennedy organizes less by chronology and more by subject matter.  Some of the later chapters are about &quot;Cardiac Surgery,&quot; &quot;Transplantation,&quot; &quot;Psychiatry,&quot; etc.  I particularly liked the crisp way he dealt with psychoanalytic theory and the inefficacy of psychoanalysis.  <p>Frankly, I don't know if there is anything else quite like this available.  The recognized authority on the subject of the history of medicine in English, University College London's late Roy Porter wrote both a popular account, Blood and Guts: A Short History of Medicine (2002), and a full blown treatment, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind (1997) which Kennedy cites.  I have read the former and it is to Kennedy's book as Mary Poppins is to Hamlet.  There are other histories, but most are either not current or too voluminous or too restricted in content.  <p>Dr. Kennedy shows how various ideas and methods were developed, how they stemmed from, or were in contrast to, earlier methods; and he highlights the personalities of the practitioners as he describes what they did or discovered.  He also focuses on patients and their stories.  His style is sharp and uncluttered.  Sometimes he employs a dry, cynical wit.  At other times his report takes on extra-medical aspects that lend depth and familiarity to his portraits, as when, for example, he reports on the tragic death of transplant pioneer, Dr. David Hume. (p. 388)<p>Here are some examples of the kind of detail that I found fascinating:<p>&quot;The early Middle Ages saw little consumption of animal protein by the peasants, but legume production, which increased with the agricultural revolution, reduced the dependence on carbohydrates and led to rapid population growth again.&quot; (p. 69)<p>And on the following page: &quot;Women lived shorter lives than men in the Middle Ages...This is attributed to the hazards of childbirth, but also to an iron deficient diet...[because] animal protein was not available.&quot;<p>&quot;...[A]lthough opium offered some relief of pain...until the anesthesia era, speed was the sign of the good surgeon.&quot; (p. 85)<p>&quot;Infectious diseases were uncommon in primitive societies because the available pool of susceptible individuals was too small and the contact with other groups was not common.&quot; (p. 87)  Indeed, infectious disease is part of the price we pay for agriculture and civilization.<p>Quoting Freud: &quot;I often console myself with the idea that, even though we achieve so little therapeutically, at least we understand why more cannot be achieved.&quot; (p. 401)  This is doubly ironic since Freud was even deceived in what he thought he understood.  A few pages later Kennedy drily remarks that psychotherapy &quot;is useful in helping adults to deal with life stress.  It has little or no role in treating psychosis.  The serious mental illnesses are increasingly seen as biological disorders.&quot; (p. 424)<p>The only weakness of this book is that it could have used a more meticulous editor.  (The proofreading is excellent.)  Kennedy's writing style is fast-forward, actually suggesting to me how medical history might be written had somebody like, say, novelist James M. Cain taken his hand to it.  The words just rush down the page.  Kennedy has so much to say and he wants to get it all said.  Sometimes one has to read a sentence twice since sometimes his tenses are a little eccentric, and parallel construction is not always strictly observed.<p>There are two indices, one for names, but I notice that the aforementioned Roy Porter, for example, does not appear in either of them.  Probably the names in the footnotes were left out.  Also the references (545 of them) are collected at the end of each chapter, which is fine, but there is no overall alphabetized bibliography.  This is a pet peeve of mine since one has to chase through chapter after chapter to see if a particular work is cited.<p>However Kennedy more than makes up for this deficiency with what he calls a &quot;Postscript&quot; which is a lightly annotated bibliography organized into the categories, &quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; &quot;General Sources,&quot; and sources by individual chapters.<p>Bottom line: the best history of medicine that I have found and a delight to read.\", 'doi': '10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'amazon_id': '0974946656', 'title': 'Medical History'}\n",
        "{'review_text': \"Personally I always enjoy a historical book that actually discusses history and not some surgically altered history that only reports the things that went right.  That is what you get with &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science &amp; Medicine&quot;.  Not only do you read about the great advances in medicine but also about the mistakes that were made along the way.  Although the book was written with the first year medical student in mind it is easy enough to read and understand by those with only a passing knowledge of basic first aid.  Perhaps one sentence from the Forward best describes the writing style - &quot;...it has been written to be read, rather than studied.&quot;  <p>Dr. Kennedy states that this book was not widely accepted by the academic presses and so was published independently.  It is fairly obvious that one of the reasons this might be the case is his candid examination of the history of medicine.  In an age when most practitioners of the medical profession seem to feel that they have perfect knowledge, Dr. Kennedy's book shows that they have often been wrong with tragic results.  Take for instance the case of Ignaz Semmelweiss who worked in a hospital where there was a twenty-nine percent mortality rate for women giving birth.  Through experimentation and deduction he came to believe that washing your hands between patients and after autopsies would cause this rate to drop.  He ordered that hand washing would be done between patients and the rate of death dropped drastically.  However, since he had not reason why it worked it was resisted, he eventually resigned (other historians have noted that he was forced to resign) and the doctors returned to their old habits and the old mortality rate.  After all it made no sense to them that something they could not see could make any difference.  Many people will immediately see the similarities between things like this and modern attitude of medical science as related to alternative therapies - if we don't yet understand how it works then it must not work.  Most medical history texts are severely sanitized to keep such historical errors out.  So, it is really no surprise that this book, which portrays history as it was, from many primary sources, is not the most popular one among the medical establishment.<p>Personally, I enjoyed the book but I am one of those who enjoys history from a viewpoint of accuracy - warts and all.  Still you should be prepared to have some of your history that you learned in high school discredited.  I remember learning that Louis Pasteur invented innoculations to prevent disease in the later 1800's, but the fact is that Charles Maitland and others were doing it in the 1700's.  &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the history and progression of medicine.\", 'doi': '10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'amazon_id': '0974946656', 'title': 'Medical History'}\n",
        "{'review_text': \"This is both an extremely ambitious and enormously entertaining history of the development of the medical treatment of human beings throughout the ages. It is ambitious in that the author attempts to survey the field from prehistory until the present day, and to do so in less than five hundred pages. The scope means that at times things of necessity have to be left out. For instance, the great story in science as a whole (and in medicine in particular) between classical antiquity and the early 17th century is the growth and eventual downfall of Aristotelianism, which provided the scientific background for nearly every branch of scientific endeavor during that time. Many of the key events of that story are briefly recounted, but many are not (e.g., allied discoveries by Galileo in astronomy that refuted Aristotelian assumptions). Still, given the limitations of space, this is an admirable treatment of the subject. To deal with every issue comprehensibly would have expanded dramatically the size of the book, which would have given the lie to the title. My one serious objection to the book is that the book does not have an overarching narrative structure. I'm not always sure what particular story is being told. Nonetheless, it is impossible to come away from the book without a far deeper appreciation for the remarkable journey medicine has undertaken over the centuries. It also makes me enormously grateful that I am alive today, and not in some previous century.<p>Above all, this is a fun, engaging, thoroughly entertaining book. Although the book sometimes veers towards the encyclopedic, the style at all times is anecdotal. The author loves his subject, and especially delights in the quirkier side of things. There are mountains of fascinating trivia, and as a lover of great trivia I was constantly saying to myself, &quot;Wow, I didn't know that!&quot; Some of the more fascinating bits of the book are when Kennedy discusses famous individuals and the way in which disease may have affected them, such as Ivan the Terrible or Henry VIII. Even in modern medical discoveries, he has an eye for the unusual.<p>This is also, however, a very educational book. The amount of information contained in its pages is fairly staggering. One great use for the book is to read through the sections on a particular epoch if one is engaged in historical reading. But the book is more than a collection of interesting facts. The reader gains an appreciation for the way that medical practice has developed over the centuries. For instance, Kennedy discusses how before the invention of anesthesia speed was a highly esteemed virtue in a surgeon. Surgery was performed quickly, and as a result there was less of an emphasis on working carefully and carefully suturing. But with the development of anesthesia, surgery slowed down, and surgeons took more care to operate with great care and to minimize injury to tissue. This is merely one random example out of thousands.<p>One of the most appealing aspects of the book is the deeply personal style of the author. Closely aligned with his love of the anecdotes and trivia is his eye for the humorous side of things. He also writes with a personal touch. In discussing some medical condition, he will mention that he had had such a case himself at such and such a point, or that someone had devised a form of pediatric surgery, and he later had as a patient the second recipient ever of that treatment. Or he will mention that his mother's uncle had a certain medical condition, or aunt was a nurse for a famous doctor.<p>This truly is a book suited for a variety of audiences. I have a strong interest in history, and as a result I enjoyed most the first half, in part because I had the background to understand everything there pretty easily. I struggled a bit more in the second half as medicine became more specialized, but I imagine that this half would be of greater interest to medical students or physicians. The main thing that I want to emphasize is that both the medical student and the educated nonspecialist will equally find much to enjoy in the book. Similarly, one could also employ the book merely as a reference work, or read it several chapters at a time. It is rare, however, that a book can be so educational over such a wide-ranging subject, and entertain so thoroughly at the same time.\", 'doi': '10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'amazon_id': '0974946656', 'title': 'Medical History'}\n",
        "{'review_text': \"I couldn't put it down, because it hit so many of my buttons: history, medical sciences, and just plain storytelling. While I'm most known in network engineering, clinical medicine has always been an intellectual love. While I often tell people &quot;I'm not a doctor but I simulate them on computers,&quot; I learned a great deal from this book -- above all, the connections and less-than-obvious relationships between concepts.  Kennedy chronicles both the major insights and the terribly wrong blind alleys that characterize what many call the &quot;youngest science&quot;.\\t  It's too easy to forget, looking at modern medicine, how recent most developments are -- and yet how many ancient insights were correct. Kennedy literally goes back to the dawn of history, explaining original ideas, how they were expanded upon, how they were confused, and how they finally converged into a scientific discipline -- that remains an art.\\t  While the author occasionally does drop to the molecular level, it isn't necessary to have a detailed background to understand the map he reveals. There are enough very specific insights to give a medical expert a few pleasant doubletakes, as well as to introduce the layman to how we reached our current views.\\t  There were times that I wanted more detail on a technical topic, but isn't it traditional for the great storytellers to leave you hanging, wanting more?\\t  The author doesn't ignore that medicine always exists in a social and technical context.  Religion has both suppressed and enhanced medical knowledge, and he presents both ends of the spectrum.  Anyone who gets into the real world of hospitals, to say nothing of academic research, learns very quickly of the profusion of enormous egos -- and the politics resulting from them. While people may be pictured smiling as they receive Nobel Prizes, quite a number were suppressing rage at their co-awardees, or feeling terrible because their collaborator wasn't up there as well.\\t  In modern times, more general financial and political interests have a great deal to do with the practice of medicine. Kennedy has definite opinions on where managed care and outcomes research improved care, and also where they've gone horribly wrong.\", 'doi': '10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'amazon_id': '0974946656', 'title': 'Medical History'}\n",

The first eight chapters aptly cover the history of early medicine and science described in more detail than typical medical history. Then Dr. Kennedy goes on to cover the discovery of anesthesia and antisepsis, the development of modern medicine and surgery, and concludes with a history of medical economics (including the origin of medical malpractice litigation).

        "{'review_text': 'At some point in the nineteenth century, the practice of medicine was transformed into medical science. Before that time, while there were some people who critically examined techniques of treatment, most medical practitioners did more harm than good.  At best, the treatment did no harm and there was tremendous resistance by the medical profession to change, even when the benefit was clearly demonstrated. Many women died in childbirth due to infections caused by doctors going directly from dissecting cadavers to delivering babies without washing their hands. It was not until sometime in the twentieth century before it could be said that the medical profession had alleviated more suffering than it caused.\\t This book chronicles all of this and is one of best written histories that I have encountered, independent of subject. It all starts in the first few pages, where you learn that early humans who were hunter-gatherers did not suffer from many acute diseases. After populations spent generations in the same general area, most diseases had adapted to being chronic in nature. Few people died from those diseases and new ones were rarely introduced into the population.\\t Three things, leading to the rise of civilization, changed that. The first was the domestication of animals, which allowed for the trans-species migration of diseases. This was a bit of a surprise to me, although it should not have been. The modern and deadly diseases of AIDS and Ebola are both caused by viruses that have migrated from other primates. As I write this, countries in Asia are killing enormous numbers of chickens in an attempt to prevent a disease virus from moving from chickens to humans.\\t  The second event was the development of agriculture, which required stationary populations, and allowed the numbers to grow dramatically. This led to the profession of civil engineering and how to provide potable water and dispose of waste. Until recently, this has been a chronic problem and many epidemics have been due to contaminated water.\\t The third event is the increased mobility of populations, which is a more recent event. Strains of diseases that are chronic and mild in one population due to generations of acquired immunity become plagues when introduced to new populations. So much of the history of the world has been shaped by disease, which is one of the primary themes explained in detail. The Europeans gave the Americas smallpox and the Americans gave the Europeans syphilis.  Asia gave Europe the bubonic plague, and Africa gave the world AIDS. I was very impressed with how Kennedy describes these events and explains how they changed the world.\\t Some of the most fascinating historical accounts dealt with individuals. The Russian Czar known as Ivan the Terrible was not always so terrible. In the early years of his reign, he was very enlightened, establishing schools and a legal code. However, in his later years, he earned his historical moniker, even killing his own son. His body was exhumed in the years of Soviet rule and it showed clear evidence of tertiary syphilis. Therefore, the insanity of his last years and the devastating consequences for Russian history were most likely due to his suffering from advanced syphilis. Although not proven, there are strong indications that Henry VIII of England also suffered from tertiary syphilis, which can explain some of the erratic behavior in his later years. One cannot help but be astonished at the rates of syphilitic infection in Europe a short time after it was brought back by the early explorers of the Americas. In 1599, one-third of the inhabitants of Paris were infected with syphilis. Given that it is transmitted primarily by sexual contact, this figure is incredible. It also indicates how sexually promiscuous the Parisians had to be and points out that there were times in history where people were more sexually promiscuous than they are now.\\t  One cannot help but be astonished by the resistance to change that has pervaded the medical profession throughout its existence. It would be hard to find any other group of people who have exhibited such a conservative mindset for so long. In some ways, the only place where similar mindsets can be found is in religion. On the personal side, Kennedy occasionally refers to events in his life. There are not many, but they are expressed in a very matter of fact manner. It is unusual to read something like, \\\\I was there when we tried . . .  .', None: [' the patient died.\\\\\"\\t This book is a real riveting page-turner. Once I started reading it', ' it was the only book that I read until I finished it and now I have to catch up on all my other projects.\"'], 'doi': '10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84', 'amazon_id': '0974946656', 'title': 'Medical History'}\n",

This has resulted in less emphasis on the learning of the skills of the time honored Doctor-Patient relationship and in creating the aura that physicians dwell in glass dome sanctuaries of science: the quiet moments of sharing personal fears and concerns and relieving the pain in the souls of the patient and patients' families seem relics of the past house-call/caring-physician image.

In normal fashion, Lonely Planet does a great job with historic and cultural information pertaining to a certain locality, but once again falls short on the in-depth info that many travelers would be interested in.  For instance, national parks and world heritage sites are usually not covered in enough detail, and sometimes they're not mentioned at all.  Much of the information is very basic as well, and doesn't really paint a solid picture of the park.  Sure, we all know there are animals running around, but what makes it stand out?  Notable exceptions would be Etosha and Kruger, both of which have good coverage, but so many other options exist and are just barely mentioned.  Major cities are covered well, but so many exciting points of interest are over-looked that sometimes I wonder if the publishers think that most travellers are going to spend their entire trip in wine bars and discos.

        "{'review_text': 'One would be hard pressed to accomplish significant scholarship in the area of Gothic literature without developing at least a passing acquaintance with queer criticism.  The sub-genre of the Gothic, embodied by novels containing countless instances of incestuous and homosocial relationships, not only invites, but demands the attention of a queer eye.  However, following the winding, subterraneous paths of a queer reading can be a daunting task, especially for the budding scholar of the Gothic.  One needs to be able to take into account the complex theories of foundational critics such as Freud, Foucault, Sedgwick, and Butler in order to recognize the impact queer themes and relationships might have on the reading of gothic fiction.  Unpacking the latent intricacies in the Gothic involves discerning what these queer themes are saying about the texts\\' crucial scenes.  Without a consideration of a queer reading, the Gothic loses one of its fundamental sources of influence and significance.  Consequently, the reader\\'s experience with the Gothic would prove disingenuous and wanting.\\t\\t  Thankfully, the canon of gothic criticism has George Haggerty, Professor of English at The University of California, Riverside, to shine an insightful light on its queer avenues.  Haggerty\\'s 2006 book, Queer Gothic, offers a comprehensive, yet in-depth examination of queer elements throughout the Gothic.  Haggerty introduces this text as \\\\the culmination of a career in gothic fiction\\\\\" (ix). It should be noted that Haggerty\\'s is an impressive', None: [' prolific career that includes earlier books Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form (1989)', ' Unnatural Affections: Women and Fiction in the Later 18th Century (1998)', ' and Men in Love (1999)', ' as well as numerous scholarly journal publications.\\t\\t  Haggerty begins his study with the first appearance of gothic text', \" Walpole's The Castle of Otranto\", ' and traces the development of the Gothic across time and genre', \" concluding the work with an examination of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.  At each stop on his book's nine-chapter tour\", ' Haggerty walks the reader through a close reading of queer elements at work in an average of three to four different gothic texts.

With this purpose in mind', ' Haggerty quickly asserts the existence and value of a gothic-queer connection.  In his first chapter', ' Haggerty explains that a queer reading \\\\\"can begin to show the ways in which gothic works beyond the limits of its structural `meaning\\' to change the structure of meaning itself.  Gothic fiction is about reaching into some undefinable world beyond fictional reality. . . That is why gothic fiction remains as queer as it is', ' and it also suggests why and how gothic remains to challenge the status quo and at the same time to expand its purview\\\\\" (10).  With this understanding in mind', \" Haggerty begins an exploration of the ways various texts in the gothic canon subvert the heteronormative assumptions of their day.\\t\\t  The author devotes significant attention to describing how classic gothic texts lend themselves to a queer reading.  Drawing on the gender bending and incestuous violence in Matthew Lewis's The Monk\", \" the eyebrow-raising mother-daughter relations in Ann Radcliffe's novels\", \" and the reverse Oedipal pattern in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto\", ' Haggerty makes a strong case for queer themes at work in the Gothic since its inception.

In an effort to ground his study', ' Haggerty refers frequently to several key theorists and present-day scholars.  Judith Butler and Michel Foucault both exercise influence over the study', ' as do studies by David Halperin', ' David Punter', ' Cynthia Griffin Wolff', ' and Nina Auerbach.  This support system of authorities acts as a double-edged sword', ' providing a deeper', \" more credible basis for Haggerty's arguments\", ' while simultaneously making portions of the text especially challenging for any newbies to the gothic arena.  On a related note', ' those less familiar (or concerned) with the modern incarnations of the Gothic may find the latter chapters difficult.  Thankfully', ' each part', ' if not each chapter', ' successfully stands on its own as an individual study', ' permitting some jumping around on the part of the reader.\\t\\t On the whole', \" Haggerty's study proves to be a challenging and rewarding read that offers its audience an enlightening and\", ' at times', ' humorous journey through the queer world of gothic texts.\"'], 'doi': '10.2307/40986343', 'amazon_id': '0252073533', 'title': 'Queer Gothic'}\n",

When individuals and cultures clash on questions of how to act and what is important, it can seem impossible to adjudicate between them without simply taking sides.  This is especially true when it becomes clear that both sides make sense, at least on their own terms, given the history and context out of which they arose.\\t\\tAppiah uses examples drawn from his own experience growing up in Ghana, and brings to bear ideas drawn from a range of sources, in an attempt to carve out a middle ground between \\\\dogmatic universalism\\\\\" (the view that there is one right way to live and other ways are wrong) and \\\\\"skeptical relativism\\\\\" (that suggests anything goes and every worldview and set of practices is as right', None: [' or wrongheaded', ' as any other).

This agreement to accept a \\\\\"higher power\\\\\" that adjudicates disputes can be rooted in the Hobbesian motive of self-preservation: i.e. we might see that it is in our interest to submit to the decisions of governing bodies because otherwise we are likely to kill each other.

This \\\\\"something more\\\\\" is what Appiah calls \\\\\"cosmopolitanism\\\\\" - a kind of attitude of respect for and interest in differences.  It involves', ' as he sees it', ' an extension of sympathies from the local to the global', ' but always in particular ways.  I can never know enough to care about everyone except in the most abstract and general way', ' but knowing enough about some culture other than my own to appreciate their ways and see them on their own terms', ' can help at least to minimize the strangeness of other cultures I have so far not understood.

I envy the way that he can make what I learned as logical positivism (Appiah lops off the \\\\logical\\\\\") and make it relevant in a discussion of wider cultural issues.  Though he obviously was trained in the tradition honed by Russell', None: [' Carnap', ' Frege', ' Ryle', ' Austin', ' Anscombe', ' Dummett', ' and the large contingent of American and British logicians and philosophers of language', ' none of them have informed his literary style.  In fact', ' the two writers Appiah reminds me of most are Herodotus and Montaigne.  Like them', ' he feels a license to bring into his discussion almost anything.  If he is cosmopolitan on a moral and social level', ' he is also as a multidisciplinarian.  Nor does he hesitate at mixing cultures.  Many of the most compelling passages in the book detail incidents from his experience in Ghana.\\t\\tThe point of the book is to discuss many of the problems that arise if one attempts to embrace--as Appiah clearly feels we all should--cosmopolitan ideals.  He deals interestingly with a host of issues', ' from the idea of who owns the products of a culture to the incommensurability of values from one culture to another (or their possible commensurability) to whether it is problematic when there are conflicts on fundamental issues.  As a person he seems to have been deeply molded by all of the cultural influences in which he grew up', ' but as a philosopher he is exceptionally British.  Over the decades there have been a number of British thinkers who have been able to cut through a thick wad of nonsense and discuss issues in a balanced', ' commonsensical manner.  Gilbert Ryle had this capacity', ' as did (sometimes) G. E. Moore', ' and so also Mary Midgley.  While his views are unquestionably progressive', ' Appiah always seems to avoid extremes to arrive at conclusions that are', ' above all else', ' balanced and reasonable.  He is a master at making sense.  So when philosopher Peter Unger argues that we all have a moral obligation to give every penny that we do not need for our own sustenance to organizations like UNICEF and OXFAM so that food and medicine can be purchased for the desperately poor in the Third World.  Appiah', ' on the other hand', ' believes that a world in which no one bought a ticket to the opera would be flat and uninteresting.  Besides', ' what really matters is reforming local governments in order to provide long-term transformation of the socioeconomic structures in the areas most afflicted by poverty', ' something that giving exclusively to UNICEF and OXFAM will not accomplish (though for the record', ' Appiah thinks both organizations are very important and he does not discourage contributing to them).  Though he does not state it as a principle', \" he constantly employs something akin to Aristotle's golden mean.\\t\\tI especially enjoyed his chapter on The Counter-Cosmopolitans.  He places many of today's Islamic extremists in this category\", \" though he also very correctly places many Christian fundamentalists here as well.  I have long fantasized about writing a book about contemporary proponents of Counter-Enlightenment ideas (a book I will never write because I haven't mastered the range of disciplines such a project would require).  Isaiah Berlin wrote frequently about various Counter-Enlightenment thinkers such as Hamaan\", ' but I believe it can be extended into the present for such mass movements as various religious fundamentalisms (Christian', ' Islamic', ' as well as Jewish)', ' the New Age movement', ' contemporary astrology', ' right wing political movements', \" and free market capitalism.  Obviously I can't make my claim here\", \" but I found Appiah's discussion of the counter-cosmopolitans to overlap entirely with counter-enlightenment ideals.\\t\\tI value this book not only for its ideals and the intelligent discussion of a host of thorny issues\", ' but for Appiah\\'s warm humanity and wonderful literary style.  It is not merely an intelligent book but a well-written one as well.\"'], 'doi': '10.2307/41472361', 'amazon_id': '039332933X', 'title': 'Cosmopolitanism'}\n",
        "{'review_text': 'We can move to a better neighborhood or to a different country.  But all humanity is our neighbor, like them or not.\\t\\tMr. Appiah, the renowned Princeton philosophy professor, challenges us with the paradox of a common humanity, among which, different ethnic and religious groups often do not share customs, or even the same values.  The Cosmopolitan thesis is that, despite being strangers in many ways, our common humanity provides a basis for mutual respect and compassion.\\t\\tWhat anchors the paradox at one end is that, for most of human history, we knew only our own kind, with limited need to understand, let alone to accept, the customs of people in other groups.  Over the last few centuries, increased trade and communication, as well as industrial pollution and international terrorism, has changed framework.  Since our actions can affect \\\\lives everywhere', None: ['\\\\\" ethical living implies responsibilities beyond our immediate environment and social group.  Humanity has become', ' in a sense', ' one \\\\\"tribe.\\\\\"\\t\\tMr. Appiah reminds us that the view of being a citizen of the world reflects intellectual traditions at least as old as classical times; that Marcus Aurelius', ' whose works were attractive to many Christian intellectuals', ' himself sought to suppress Christianity; that', ' then again', ' Christianity', ' whose allegiances have often fueled persecution', ' originally spread from Paul\\'s assertion of \\\\\"neither Jew nor Greek . . . . for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\\\\\"  Yet', ' Mr. Appiah also reminds us', ' respect for those different includes respect for their freedom to be separate', ' as in the case of the Amish in the United States.\\t\\tIf you find yourself often straddling the same paradox and long to find a partner in the journey', \" you will find one in Mr. Appiah's short (196 pp.)\", ' varied', ' and challenging book.  He provides examples of agreeing', ' yet agreeing to disagree.  The non-Muslim for example', \" would agree on the devout's right to make a hajj to Mecca\", ' but may not agree that a Deity has commanded it', ' or that avoiding pork is appropriate.  The paradox is exemplified in explanations of the natural world.  Even an agreement on facts leaves ambiguity in theories; e.g.', \" whether it is germs or (many tiny) spirits that cause disease.  Mr. Appiah makes a case that there are even fewer compelling arguments based on fact in the determination of values.  The journey continues to the Ghana of the author's father\", ' where we find out about \\\\\"taboos\\\\\" dealing with bush meat and menstruating women.  A distinction made here is that', ' while taboos separate peoples', ' or classes within peoples (rulers', ' nobles', ' and slaves)', ' morals differ in that they guide us in the treatment of others', ' so a taboo is a distinction with less of a difference.  Even so', ' taboos are common to all cultures; westerners eat pigs but not cats.\\t\\tA cosmopolitan understands and can live with difference', ' even when the differences are mutually understood.  A \\\\\"universalist', '\\\\\" on the other hand', ' expects agreement through understanding.  Mr. Appiah has us step back from taboos', ' to the more engaging questions of values.  Still', ' while most people in a society value fair punishment', ' not all agree that punishment is worth the risk of punishing the innocent; while men in different societies relate their honor to the chastity of related women', ' not all of these men would agree that honor compels killing a woman who is raped.  We find that reasoned argument does not compel either of these positions to those taking them.  There seems to be a sort of getting \\\\\"used to', '\\\\\" that even a great mathematician (von Neumann) would endorse as reason\\'s companion.\\t\\tMr. Appiah\\'s treads lightly across serious subjects', ' and perhaps that is a cosmopolitan virtue.  He contends that strangers are beyond communication mainly when they are imaginary; that is', ' when they are people we have not met one-to-one.  Also', ' that', ' among diversity', ' there are inevitable commonalities:  \\\\\"I have failed to get people interested in Zeno\\'s paradox in three continents.\\\\\"  That', ' when caring about others requires an \\\\\"out-group', '\\\\\" one\\'s caring is perhaps mere self-comfort.\\t\\tMr. Appiah explores the concept of cultural preservation.  He proposes a difference between preserving culture and preserving cultures.  He challenges the idea of \\\\\"authenticity', '\\\\\" as limited by the facts of history', ' such as the role of trade in the development of kente cloth and bagpipes.  The need to \\\\\"preserve\\\\\" is argued as an ignorance of how free non-Westerners are to interpret American TV and consumer products.  At worst', ' an attitude of cultural preservation condescends.  We learn that the ancients saw the value of \\\\\"contamination\\\\\":  stoic teachers traveling between city states', ' an African-born playwright', ' Publius Terentius Afer', ' using Greek ideas in Roman drama.  We are offered', ' quoting this playright', ' a golden rule:  \\\\\"I am human: nothing is alien to me.\\\\\"\\t\\tWe are given a glimpse of the founder of the scouting movement', ' collecting (or looting?)', \" as a prelude to a discussion of cultural objects.  Mr. Appiah takes us to the question of whether a Norse goblet is more valuable in a Spanish museum or in a Norwegian family's living room.  Cosmopolitanism proposes that the connection through ethnic identity across centuries is no less real than the connection through a common humanity.\\t\\tMr. Appiah includes some discussion of counter-cosmopolitans\", ' for example', ' Islamic fundamentalists', ' to help us understand by way of contrast.  The universal aspect in this case', ' and in others', ' is one that looks beyond borders or ethnicity', ' and excludes those who disbelieve.  This discussion evokes the cosmopolitan understanding that different people will have different values', ' and that this is quite acceptable (with some exception for values not worth having).  The cosmopolitan knows that one can learn from those with whom one disagrees.  The counter-cosmopolitan sees nothing to be gained by reaching out from the faithful.\\t\\tFinally', \" we are given the author's reflection on questions of sacrifice for the benefit of others.  So\", ' how much would we sacrifice to save the life of a child in a foreign country with nutrition and medicine?  One hundred dollars?  If that much', ' why not more - say', \" another hundred dollars.  Or is there a point when it's more important to go the opera?  And - is it really possible to save another's life for more than a few days\", ' given the harsh realities of their life situation.  Is it as easy as deciding to ruin a suit in order to save a child from drowning', ' and why?  What is the principle behind the answers to these questions', ' if there is one.\\t\\tThe journey continues:  Mr. Appiah provides an informative and provocative guide to how to treat strangers', ' meant of course', ' in the large.  I do not guarantee the reader will find comfortable answers', ' only insights and surprising information', ' and that your answers', ' which are how you actually live', ' will now have questions to challenge them.\"'], 'doi': '10.2307/41472361', 'amazon_id': '039332933X', 'title': 'Cosmopolitanism'}\n",
        "{'review_text': 'Appiah (the Laurence S Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy and the Center for Human Values at Princeton University)writes in an urbane introduction to the issues multiculturalism poses for our society and should be must reading for all those who want to really understand the complexity of our new century. After reading this book we might all be able to agree (to paraphrase what someone famously said about Keynes) that we are all cosmopolitian (ists) now. No one can truly escape into their own monocultural island --our cities, our media and most important our language and culture are infused with layer upon layer of global cultures whether we are aware of them or not. Appiah begins by examining the root meanings of cosmopolitianism--\\t\\t\\\\A citizen--a polites--belonged to a particular polis', None: [' a city to which he or she owed loyalty. The cosmos referred to the world', ' not in the sense of the earth but in the sense of the universe. Talk of cosmopolitianism originally signaled', ' then a rejection of the conventional view that every civilized person belonged to a community among communities.\\\\\"\\t\\tAppiah\\'s easy non academic style helps you understand the role of the Enlightenment thinkers such as Wieland--(once called the German Voltaire Appiah adds) who wrote\\t\\\\\"Cosmopolitans..regard all the people of the earth as so many branches of a single family', ' and the universe as a state', ' of which they', ' with innumerable other than rational beings', ' are citizens', ' are citizens', ' promoting together under the general laws of nature the perfection of the whole', ' while each in his own fashion is busy about his own well-being.\\\\\"\\t\\tAppiah\\'s learning is worn lightly as he answers the all important question --what does it mean to hold the view that we are citizens of the world? What happens to local allegiances--for Virginia Woolf it meant--\\\\\"freedom from unreal loyalties\\\\\" and Leo Tolstoy wrote about the \\\\\"stupidity of patriotism\\\\\"--on the opposite side of the equation are people like Hitler and Stalin who are deep foes of cosmpolitianism and we all know how that ended up. Appiah\\'s huge store of reading helps him navigate through the issue of loyalties which lies at the heart of the question. George Eliot\\'s creation of Daniel Deronda-the very English gentleman who discovers his Jewish heritage only as an adult--explains his interest in studying his heritage in these terms', ' \\\\\"I want to be an Englishman', ' but I want to understand other points of view. And I want to get rid of the a merely English attitude in studies.\\\\\"\\t\\tThe issue comes down to self definition and how we claim it--we have to be open to the idea that our cultural background creates a way we can connect with others--Eliot talks of the \\\\\"closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical.\\\\\"\\t\\tAnd this is just the introduction! The cluster of questions Appiah considers are truly wide ranging -but often remain invisible in debate--questions such \\\\\"as what we owe strangers by virtue of our shared humanity?', ' can culture be \\\\\"owned\\\\\" ?\\tAs a philosopher he can be skilled with applying some important distinctions--so for example when we talk about objective values we are really talking about desired values --some of which depend on certain facts--he gives the example of universal vaccination as being a value --but we are often prepared to give this value up when the disease has been eliminated. Where we often go astray Appiah argues is where we view an individual\\'s moral vocabulary as belonging to one individual--all the important values-such as kindness', ' cruelty are public and shared across cultures. It is first and foremost evaluative language we are using--a way of communicating to each other our preferences--if your values were not shared in language --there would be no way we could refer to them. The reason why values are important in our society is that they allow us to get things done together--we appeal to those values in order to act in the public forum--whether it is building a road', ' going to the moon', ' or making peace. Our stories that we share embody our values and certain stories are more important than others in our national culture because they enshrine some key values. So one of the purposes of studying a foreign language and reading books in translation is to appreciate the nuances of other people\\'s values.\\t\\tNot all chapters are discursive essays--some are personal meditations based on growing up in Ghana and the ways that the culture and beliefs shape someone so that conversation sometimes becomes problematic. The author gives the example of medicine and how the conversation between someone who believes in witchcraft to accept the findings of modern medicine. Why should they believe in viruses--that you cannot see? Just because you said so? You can say that you can predict who can get well but not who will get sick. In the end you have to appeal to a community of people who can test the evidence that goes beyond the anectdotal and subjective.\\t\\tThere are insights all along the way--for example the independence movements in Africa and elsewhere that brought to an end colonial rule were arguments about values--not African values per se --but values embodied in the rhetoric that had\\tguided the Allies in their conflict with the Axis powers--\\\\\"It was a conflict of interests couched in terms of the same values.\\\\\"\\t\\tImportant points are made about so called cultural purity and cultural contamination--we see so many examples of ethnic communities within hetrogeneous cultures choosing to live within their own cultural borders--but as Appiah so eloquently argues--\\\\\"cultural purity is an oxymoron\\\\\"--multiculturalism is in some shape or form in all our lives--in the Middle East', ' in China', ' in Ghana and in our own western world. The entire history of culture has been related to mixing one cultural strain with another--from the Roman through to the Alexanderian and British empires to the American century--cultures are continually reinterpreted and reinvented. Intolerance for others is bred of universalistic fundamentalist creeds whether they be Islamic or Christian or Jewish can as we know all too well lead to dangerous consequences--however as Appiah reminds us the truly toxic aspects of this are not so much in terms of those beliefs but their fear and sometimes prohibition of conversation. Without conversation they can extend their belief that \\\\\"not everyone matters\\\\\" and other equally savage ideas and not owe anyone a justification as to why. They don\\'t want to be drawn into explaining precisely because they don\\'t want to have to justify themselves or their beliefs to others--because they know that their values are not ultimately defensible. Reason is at the center of it all--\\\\\"come let us reason together\\\\\" should be the motto of every civilized person--it offers a ground for your thinking and my thinking.\\t\\tIn terms of the central question--what are our obligations to others--Appiah\\'s answer is to be common sensical--it is to do \\\\\"our fair share\\\\\"--we cannot be required to do more. But what is our \\\\\"fair share\\\\\"? How do we deal with the fact that so many people are not doing their fair share? He discusses this and other issues--such as the paradox that one of the world\\'s greatest capitalists is providing billions to help eradicate preventable diseases around the globe and our economic system allows the average cow to live on a $2.50 a day subsidy when 3 billion people live on less than $2 dollars a day. Appiah points out that Jeffrey Sachs has argued that we can eradicate extreme poverty for about $150 billion a year for 20 years. Clearly we can do better', ' as Appiah argues it is a \\\\\"demand of simple morality\\\\\" and we can also agree with him that this end might be more achievable \\\\\"if we made civilization more cosmopolitan\\\\\"\"'], 'doi': '10.2307/41472361', 'amazon_id': '039332933X', 'title': 'Cosmopolitanism'}\n",
